<img alt="On Running Cloudwander Waterproof hiking shoes on rocky terrain" src="https://www.switchbacktravel.com/sites/default/files/articles%20/On%20Cloudwander%20Waterproof%20hiking%20shoes%20%28standing%20on%20rock%20-%20m%29.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: 400px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 18px;">On Running has revolutionized the hiking footwear market with their innovative CloudTec technology, originally designed for road running but brilliantly adapted for trail use. When I first discovered <i><a href="https://explorenationalparks.store/on-running-shoes" style="color: #2c5530; text-decoration: none;">On Running shoes</a></i>, I was skeptical about their unconventional design. However, after extensive testing across various terrains, I've found that their unique approach to cushioning and support offers distinct advantages for certain hiking scenarios.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 18px;">The Swiss engineering behind these shoes focuses on three core principles: superior shock absorption through their patented Cloud pods, lightweight construction that reduces fatigue on long hikes, and versatile performance that transitions seamlessly from city sidewalks to mountain trails. This makes them particularly appealing for women who want <b><a href="https://explorenationalparks.store/best-on-running-shoes-for-women" style="color: #2c5530; text-decoration: none;">best on running shoes for women</a></b> that can handle diverse environments.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 18px;">What sets on running hiking shoes women's models apart is their focus on anatomical differences in women's feet. The narrower heel construction, adjusted arch support, and gender-specific last ensure a more secure and comfortable fit. During my conversations with park rangers in Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, many mentioned seeing increased numbers of hikers wearing On shoes, particularly among women who prioritize comfort during long-distance hikes.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0;">The brand offers three primary hiking-focused models: the Cloudwander Waterproof for versatile day hiking, the Cloudhorizon Waterproof for maximum cushioning, and the Cloudrock series for more technical terrain. Each addresses different hiking needs while maintaining On's signature comfort technology.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 20px; border-left: 5px solid #4a7c59; padding-left: 20px;">Detailed Review: On Cloudwander Waterproof</h2>
<img alt="On Running Cloudwander Waterproof women's hiking shoe profile view" src="https://www.backcountry.com/images/items/1200/ONF/ONFB070/NAVDES_D5.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px; height: 350px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); float: left; margin-right: 25px;"/>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 18px;">The Cloudwander Waterproof represents On Running's entry into the hiking market, and it's a compelling first attempt. Priced around $180-200, this shoe targets day hikers who want the comfort of a running shoe with the protection needed for moderate trails. After testing these extensively on everything from desert paths in Joshua Tree to muddy Pacific Northwest trails, I can confidently say they excel in specific conditions while having limitations in others.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 18px;">The waterproof membrane performs admirably in light rain and stream crossings, though it's not as breathable as I'd prefer for summer hiking. The CloudTec sole provides excellent shock absorption on hard-packed trails, making these shoes particularly comfortable for women with knee issues or those transitioning from road running to trail hiking. The grip is adequate for most maintained trails but struggles on loose rock or steep, wet surfaces.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 18px;">Construction quality impresses with reinforced toe protection and durable upper materials. However, some Reddit users report premature wear around the heel area after 200-300 miles, particularly for those with wider feet who experience more friction. The fit runs true to size with a slightly narrow midfoot that may require adjustment for some foot shapes.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0; clear: both;">For day hikers covering 5-10 miles on established trails, the Cloudwander offers exceptional comfort and adequate performance. However, those planning technical routes or multi-day backpacking should consider more robust alternatives from <b><a href="https://explorenationalparks.store/best-on-shoes-for-running" style="color: #2c5530; text-decoration: none;">best on shoes for running</a></b> category or traditional hiking boot manufacturers.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 20px; border-left: 5px solid #4a7c59; padding-left: 20px;">Detailed Review: On Cloudhorizon Waterproof</h2>
<img alt="On Cloudhorizon Waterproof women's hiking shoe with maximum cushioning" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/hnk2vsx53n6l/1lmDZecs6QIo4LMGVbLZDW/1abfa860b6bfdcd0ebf9c27325877869/4638c6bb9f885093db04dcecafaaba9fc6b539fb.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px; height: 400px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); float: right; margin-left: 25px;"/>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 18px;">The Cloudhorizon represents On Running's maximum cushioning approach to hiking footwear. With significantly more stack height than the Cloudwander, this shoe targets hikers who prioritize comfort above all else, particularly those dealing with foot pain or joint issues. During my 15-mile test hike through the Appalachian Trail section in Virginia, these shoes provided unmatched underfoot cushioning that kept my feet comfortable throughout the entire journey.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 18px;">The trade-off for this exceptional cushioning becomes apparent on technical terrain. The high stack height and soft midsole reduce ground feel and can feel unstable on uneven surfaces. Professional reviewers consistently note this as the Cloudhorizon's primary weakness, making it less suitable for off-trail hiking or scrambling. However, for maintained trail hiking, especially on hard surfaces like fire roads or rocky paths, the comfort level is exceptional.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 18px;">User reviews on Amazon and hiking forums reveal a pattern: hikers either love or hate the Cloudhorizon, with little middle ground. Those with previous foot injuries, plantar fasciitis, or knee problems often consider these shoes revelatory, while more technical hikers find them too soft and imprecise. The waterproof construction holds up well, though breathability suffers in hot conditions.</p>

</div>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0; clear: both;">The Cloudhorizon works best for hikers who spend most of their time on established trails and value comfort over performance. If you're someone who often experiences foot fatigue or joint pain during long hikes, these shoes might be worth the premium price point of around $190-210.

<h2 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 20px; border-left: 5px solid #4a7c59; padding-left: 20px;">Detailed Review: On Cloudrock Waterproof</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 18px;">The Cloudrock series represents On Running's most technical hiking offering, available in both low and mid-height versions. Unlike the Cloudwander and Cloudhorizon, which prioritize comfort, the Cloudrock focuses on durability and performance in challenging conditions. After extensive testing in the rugged terrain of Colorado's Front Range and Utah's desert landscapes, I found this model addresses many of the durability concerns associated with other On hiking shoes.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 18px;">The Missiongrip outsole provides significantly better traction than other On models, particularly on loose rock and steep terrain. The reinforced upper construction shows improved abrasion resistance, addressing one of the primary criticisms of earlier On hiking shoes. During a challenging 12-mile hike through Rocky Mountain National Park's more technical trails, these shoes provided confidence-inspiring grip and stability.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 18px;">However, the Cloudrock sacrifices some of the signature On comfort for this improved performance. The firmer midsole provides better ground connection and stability but delivers less of the bouncy, cushioned feel that makes other On shoes distinctive. Weight also increases slightly, though they remain lighter than traditional hiking boots. The waterproof construction proves reliable, and breathability is better than expected for a fully waterproof shoe.</p>

</div>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0;">For hikers who love On's philosophy but need more technical performance, the Cloudrock strikes a reasonable balance. It's the model I recommend for those planning more challenging terrain or who need durability for high-mileage hiking. Consider pairing these with insights from <b><a href="https://explorenationalparks.store/best-on-running-shoes-for-walking" style="color: #2c5530; text-decoration: none;">best on running shoes for walking</a></b> for comprehensive footwear planning.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 20px; border-left: 5px solid #4a7c59; padding-left: 20px;">My Personal Experience Testing On Running Trail Shoes</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 18px;">Over the past two years, I've logged over 800 miles in various <b>on running hiking shoes women's</b> models across diverse terrain and conditions. My testing philosophy involves real-world scenarios rather than controlled lab conditions, taking these shoes through everything from early-season snow in the Sierra Nevada to desert heat in Arizona's Sonoran wilderness.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 18px;">My first pair of Cloudwander shoes performed admirably during a week-long hiking trip through Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The comfort level throughout 8-10 mile daily hikes was exceptional, and my usual foot fatigue was noticeably reduced. However, I discovered their limitations during a more technical section near Cataract Falls, where the grip proved inadequate on wet rocks, requiring extra caution and slower pace.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 18px;">The breakthrough moment came during a challenging 14-mile hike through Glacier National Park's Highline Trail. Wearing the Cloudhorizon, I experienced virtually no foot discomfort despite the long distance and varied terrain. A park ranger I spoke with mentioned seeing more hikers succeed on longer trails since switching to highly cushioned shoes, confirming my experience. The extra cushioning proved particularly beneficial during the rocky descent from Logan Pass.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 18px;">Seasonal testing revealed important insights about waterproof performance. In Pacific Northwest conditions, the membrane works well for light rain and stream crossings but can feel clammy during intense summer hikes. I learned to choose non-waterproof versions for hot, dry conditions and reserve waterproof models for spring hiking or unpredictable weather.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0;">My durability experience aligns with many user reports: expect 400-600 miles from most On hiking shoes, which is reasonable for the price point but less than traditional hiking footwear. The key is matching the right model to your specific hiking style and terrain preferences.

<h2 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 25px; border-left: 5px solid #4a7c59; padding-left: 20px;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 25px;">Are On Running hiking shoes durable enough for regular trail use?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">Based on extensive testing and user feedback, On Running hiking shoes typically last 400-600 miles depending on terrain and hiking style. While this is less than traditional hiking boots, it's reasonable for their lightweight construction and comfort focus. The Cloudrock series shows improved durability compared to earlier models. For maximum longevity, rotate between multiple pairs and choose the appropriate model for your terrain type. Proper care, including regular cleaning and allowing shoes to dry completely between hikes, can extend their lifespan significantly.</p>
<h3 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 25px;">Do On Running women's hiking shoes run true to size?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">Most On Running hiking shoes run true to size, though the fit tends to be slightly narrow in the midfoot area. Women with wider feet may need to size up by half a size for optimal comfort. The toe box provides adequate room for toe splay, which is important for long hikes. I recommend trying shoes on in the afternoon when feet are naturally swollen to simulate hiking conditions. The lacing system allows for good adjustability, and the shoes typically require minimal break-in time. Always test the fit with hiking socks, as this can significantly impact sizing requirements.</p>
<h3 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 25px;">Which On Running hiking shoe is best for beginners?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">The Cloudwander Waterproof is ideal for beginning hikers due to its versatile design and moderate price point. It provides excellent comfort for established trail hiking while offering waterproof protection for unpredictable conditions. The shoe's lightweight construction and responsive cushioning help reduce fatigue during longer hikes, which is crucial for building endurance and confidence. Beginners should avoid the ultra-soft Cloudhorizon until they develop better trail awareness, as its high stack height can mask important ground feedback. Start with day hikes on maintained trails to assess your compatibility with On's unique design philosophy before committing to longer adventures.</p>
<h3 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 25px;">Can On hiking shoes handle wet and muddy conditions?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">The waterproof versions of On hiking shoes perform well in light to moderate wet conditions, including stream crossings and light rain. However, the grip limitations become more pronounced on muddy or slippery surfaces compared to traditional hiking boots with more aggressive tread patterns. The CloudTec sole design can collect debris in muddy conditions, requiring frequent cleaning to maintain traction. For predominantly wet hiking conditions, consider the Cloudrock series with its improved Missiongrip outsole. Non-waterproof versions dry quickly but obviously lack moisture protection. Plan your route and weather conditions accordingly, and always carry traction devices for challenging winter conditions.</p>
<h3 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 25px;">Are On Running hiking shoes suitable for backpacking?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">On Running hiking shoes work best for ultralight backpacking with pack weights under 25-30 pounds. Their lightweight construction and comfort-focused design make them popular among thru-hikers and minimalist backpackers who prioritize fast movement over maximum support. However, the softer midsole construction provides less lateral stability under heavy loads compared to traditional hiking boots. For multi-day trips with heavier packs or challenging terrain, consider the Cloudrock series or traditional backpacking boots. Many successful long-distance hikers use On shoes, but success depends on pack weight management, route selection, and personal foot strength. Gradually increase pack weight and distance to test your setup before committing to major backpacking trips.</p>
<h3 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 25px;">How do On hiking shoes compare to traditional hiking boots?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0; line-height: 1.6;">On hiking shoes prioritize comfort, lightweight design, and versatility, while traditional hiking boots emphasize durability, ankle support, and protection. On shoes excel for day hiking, maintained trails, and hikers with joint issues, typically weighing 30-40% less than comparable boots. Traditional boots offer superior durability (often 2-3x the lifespan), better ankle protection, and more aggressive traction for technical terrain. The choice depends on your hiking style: choose On shoes for comfort-focused day hiking and well-maintained trails, or traditional boots for heavy loads, technical terrain, and maximum durability. Many experienced hikers own both types, selecting based on specific trip requirements and seasonal conditions.</p>
