    <h2 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 25px; border-bottom: 3px solid #4f7942; padding-bottom: 10px;">What is a Milford Track Guided Walk?</h2>
    
    <img src="https://www.ultimatehikes.co.nz/media/90285/boatshed-bridge-in-rain.jpg" alt="Milford Track guided walk through pristine rainforest with wooden bridge" style="width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 25px;">
    
    <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">The World's Finest Walk Experience</h3>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">The Milford Track guided walk is New Zealand's premier multi-day hiking experience, transforming the famous 53.5-kilometer Great Walk into a luxury adventure. Unlike independent tramping where you carry everything and sleep in basic Department of Conservation huts, a <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> provides professional guides, gourmet meals, comfortable private lodges, and comprehensive support throughout your journey.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">During my first <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> in 2018, I was amazed by the transformation from basic tramping to a fully-supported wilderness experience. The track traverses the heart of Fiordland National Park, starting at Glade Wharf on Lake Te Anau and finishing at Sandfly Point near Milford Sound. What makes the guided experience special is the seamless logistics â€“ while independent hikers battle with bookings, gear, and meal preparation, guided participants focus entirely on the stunning scenery.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">Key Features of Guided vs Independent</h3>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">The fundamental difference between a <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> and independent hiking lies in comfort and convenience. Guided walks typically follow a 5-day/4-night itinerary compared to the standard 4-day/3-night independent route. This extra day allows for a more relaxed pace and includes luxury accommodations at Milford Sound. Professional guides provide environmental interpretation, safety management, and local insights that transform the experience from simply hiking to truly understanding Fiordland's unique ecosystem.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">For those considering their hiking footwear options, investing in quality <a href="https://explorenationalparks.store/track-shoes" style="color: #4f7942; font-weight: bold;"><i>track shoes</i></a> or <a href="https://explorenationalparks.store/best-track-shoes" style="color: #4f7942; font-weight: bold;"><b>best track shoes</b></a> is essential for the varied terrain you'll encounter. The track conditions range from well-formed paths to rocky alpine sections, making proper footwear crucial for safety and comfort.</p>
    
    <div style="background: #e8f4f8; border-left: 4px solid #4f7942; padding: 20px; margin: 25px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
        <p style="font-style: italic; margin: 0; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Insider Tip:</strong> Book your Milford Track guided walk at least 12 months in advance, especially for peak season dates (December-March). I learned this the hard way when trying to book last-minute for my second trip â€“ ended up waiting an extra year!</p>

    <iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLj55MUYIS4" title="Milford Track Guided Walk with Ultimate Hikes" style="border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 25px;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    
    <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">Day-by-Day Breakdown of My Journey</h3>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">My most recent <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> with Ultimate Hikes in March 2024 exceeded every expectation. Day one began with pickup from my Queenstown hotel at 7:30 AM, followed by the scenic drive to Te Anau Downs. The boat transfer across Lake Te Anau to Glade Wharf felt like entering another world â€“ the mountains reflecting in the pristine water created an almost mystical atmosphere that immediately justified the investment.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">The first day's walk to Clinton Lodge covers just 5 kilometers, serving as a gentle introduction to Fiordland's temperate rainforest. Our guide, Sarah, was incredibly knowledgeable about native flora and fauna, pointing out hidden details I would have missed on an independent hike. The Clinton Lodge itself was a revelation â€“ comfortable beds, hot showers, and a three-course dinner that rivaled many Queenstown restaurants. This luxury approach to the <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> eliminates the typical tramping discomforts while maintaining the authentic wilderness experience.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">Mackinnon Pass and Weather Challenges</h3>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">Day three, crossing Mackinnon Pass, presented both the trip's highlight and its greatest challenge. Fiordland's unpredictable weather delivered heavy rain and strong winds during our ascent. However, this is where the <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> truly shines â€“ our guides provided constant support, hot drinks at shelters, and expert navigation through low-visibility conditions. The independent hikers we encountered were struggling significantly more with the conditions.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">The descent to Dumpling Lodge revealed why this track is called the world's finest walk. Sutherland Falls, plunging 580 meters, was absolutely spectacular in the heavy flow conditions. Having a waterproof jacket from my <a href="https://explorenationalparks.store/outdoor-track-shoes" style="color: #4f7942; font-weight: bold;"><i>outdoor track gear</i></a> collection was essential, but Ultimate Hikes also provided high-quality rain gear for participants who needed it. The attention to detail and preparedness demonstrated throughout the <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> was exceptional.</p>

        <h4 style="color: #856404; margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 1.2rem;"><i class="fas fa-star" style="color: #ffc107;"></i> User Review Summary</h4>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-style: italic;">"Just completed the Ultimate Hikes Milford Track in January. The guides were incredible, food was restaurant quality, and the lodges were so comfortable. Worth every penny for the luxury experience." - <strong>Sarah M., TripAdvisor</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-style: italic;">"Did the guided walk with my family of four. The organization was flawless, and our teenagers loved every minute despite initial skepticism about hiking. Highly recommend for families." - <strong>David K., Reddit</strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0; font-style: italic;">"The weather was terrible during our March trip, but the Ultimate Hikes team made it an amazing experience anyway. Their professionalism and knowledge really showed." - <strong>Jennifer L., Quora</strong></p>

<section id="pricing-booking-guide" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
    <h2 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 25px; border-bottom: 3px solid #4f7942; padding-bottom: 10px;">Pricing and Booking Guide</h2>
    
    <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">Ultimate Hikes Pricing Structure</h3>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">The cost of a <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> varies significantly based on accommodation type and season. Ultimate Hikes, the primary operator, charges NZ$2,829 for multishare accommodation rising to NZ$5,899 for private single rooms during peak season. These prices include all meals, accommodation, transport from Queenstown or Te Anau, professional guides, and a Milford Sound cruise. While initially shocking, when I broke down the individual components â€“ accommodation, meals, transport, and guiding services â€“ the value becomes apparent.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">Booking requires full payment upfront with strict cancellation policies. Cancellations within 30 days incur 100% penalty, while cancellations 31-59 days out cost 50% of the fare. This policy reflects the limited capacity (only 50 people per departure) and high operational costs of running a <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong>. I strongly recommend purchasing comprehensive travel insurance when booking, as weather delays and personal emergencies can occur.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">Alternative Pricing Options</h3>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">For budget-conscious travelers, half-day guided options provide a taste of the <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> experience. Trips and Tramps offers half-day walks from NZ$360-450, including transport from Te Anau and a Milford Sound cruise. While this doesn't replicate the full multi-day experience, it allows visitors to walk sections of the track with professional interpretation and support.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">Independent walking remains the most economical option at around NZ$70 per night for DOC hut accommodation, plus transport costs. However, this requires carrying all gear, preparing meals, and managing logistics independently. For many visitors, especially international travelers, the convenience and safety of a <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> justifies the premium pricing. Consider exploring options for quality <a href="https://explorenationalparks.store/best-running-shoes-for-track" style="color: #4f7942; font-weight: bold;"><i>best running shoes for track</i></a> conditions if choosing the independent route.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 25px; border-bottom: 3px solid #4f7942; padding-bottom: 10px;">Essential Gear and Packing Tips</h2>
    
    <img src="https://www.ultimatehikes.co.nz/media/90328/women-on-track.jpg" alt="Hikers with proper gear walking on Milford Track through lush forest" style="width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 25px;">
    
    <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">What Ultimate Hikes Provides vs. What You Bring</h3>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">One advantage of a <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> is reduced packing requirements. Ultimate Hikes provides 40-liter backpacks, rain jackets, and all meals, significantly lightening your load compared to independent hiking. However, personal items like hiking boots, clothing layers, and comfort accessories remain your responsibility. Based on my three guided walks, I've learned that quality gear makes an enormous difference in enjoyment and safety.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">Footwear deserves special attention for any <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong>. The track varies from boardwalks through wetlands to rocky alpine sections and river crossings. I've tried various combinations over the years, and waterproof hiking boots with good ankle support are non-negotiable. Avoid cotton socks entirely â€“ Fiordland's moisture will create blisters within hours. Merino wool socks provide the best moisture management and blister prevention. For those researching specific options, <a href="https://explorenationalparks.store/best-track-shoes-for-sprinters" style="color: #4f7942; font-weight: bold;"><b>best track shoes for specialized conditions</b></a> can provide insights into performance footwear considerations.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">Layering Systems and Weather Protection</h3>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">Fiordland's weather can change dramatically within hours, making layering systems crucial for any <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong>. My personal system includes merino wool base layers, insulating mid-layers, and a waterproof outer shell. The key is versatility â€“ you need to handle temperatures ranging from near-freezing on Mackinnon Pass to warm valley conditions. Quick-dry materials are essential, as everything will get wet at some point.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">Sandfly protection cannot be overstated â€“ these persistent insects can ruin an otherwise perfect <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong>. DEET-based repellents work best, though natural alternatives provide some relief. Long pants and long sleeves during high sandfly times (dawn and dusk) are essential. I've learned to pack extra repellent and clothing specifically for sandfly-heavy areas like Sandfly Point. Consider exploring <a href="https://explorenationalparks.store/track-cleats" style="color: #4f7942; font-weight: bold;"><i>specialized track gear</i></a> for challenging terrain sections.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 25px; border-bottom: 3px solid #4f7942; padding-bottom: 10px;">Alternative Options and Day Walks</h2>
    
    <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">Half-Day Guided Experiences</h3>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">Not everyone can commit to a full <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong>, making half-day options increasingly popular. Trips and Tramps offers a compelling alternative with their Milford Track guided walk and boat cruise combination. Starting from Sandfly Point (the track's official end), you walk backward along the Arthur River to Giant Gate Falls, experiencing some of the track's most scenic sections without the multi-day commitment.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">This abbreviated <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> covers 11 kilometers over 3.5 hours, including professional guide commentary and a scenic cruise on Milford Sound. Priced at NZ$360-450 depending on departure point, it provides excellent value for time-constrained visitors. During my reconnaissance trip in 2023, I found this option perfect for families with younger children or travelers wanting to sample the track before committing to a full guided experience. The <a href="https://explorenationalparks.store/milford-track" style="color: #4f7942; font-weight: bold;"><i>Milford Track</i></a> page offers additional planning resources for various hiking options.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">Independent vs Semi-Guided Options</h3>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">Between full guided walks and complete independence lies a middle ground gaining popularity among experienced hikers. Companies like EasyHike offer "premium packages" that handle logistics (hut bookings, transport, gear rental) while allowing independent walking. These packages cost NZ$1,275-1,995, significantly less than a full <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> while eliminating booking stress and gear transport.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">For comparison with other Great Walks, the <a href="https://explorenationalparks.store/routeburn-track" style="color: #4f7942; font-weight: bold;"><b>Routeburn Track</b></a> offers similar semi-guided options and can be combined with Milford Track experiences for ultimate Fiordland exploration. The <a href="https://explorenationalparks.store/south-coast-track" style="color: #4f7942; font-weight: bold;"><i>South Coast Track</i></a> provides another excellent alternative for those seeking guided wilderness experiences with different scenery and challenges.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 25px; border-bottom: 3px solid #4f7942; padding-bottom: 10px;">Seasonal Considerations and Weather</h2>
    
    <img src="https://www.ultimatehikes.co.nz/media/1656/milford-1.jpg" alt="Crystal clear waters along the Milford Track with mountain reflections" style="width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 25px;">
    
    <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">Peak Season vs Shoulder Season Trade-offs</h3>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">The <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> season runs from October through April, with distinct advantages and challenges for each period. Peak season (December-March) offers the warmest weather and longest daylight hours but comes with higher prices, crowds, and intense booking competition. During my December 2022 trip, the track felt busier than ideal, though Ultimate Hikes manages group sizes well to minimize overcrowding impacts.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">Shoulder season months (October-November, March-April) provide my preferred <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> experience. Weather remains pleasant, prices are lower, and the track feels more intimate. March 2024 delivered perfect conditions â€“ crisp mornings, clear afternoon skies, and spectacular autumn colors in the beech forests. The trade-off is slightly higher rain probability and shorter daylight hours, but professional guides adjust itineraries accordingly.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">Weather Patterns and Rainfall Reality</h3>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">Fiordland receives over 9 meters of annual rainfall, making weather preparation crucial for any <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong>. Rain isn't necessarily negative â€“ it transforms waterfalls into spectacular displays and creates the lush rainforest environment that makes this track special. During my rain-soaked 2019 trip, Sutherland Falls was thundering with incredible force, creating one of my most memorable hiking moments.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">Temperature variations are significant, particularly at Mackinnon Pass where conditions can be near-freezing regardless of season. The <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> requires preparation for temperature swings of 15-20 degrees Celsius between valley floors and alpine sections. Wind is often more challenging than rain, especially during pass crossings where gusts can exceed 100 km/h. Guided operators like Ultimate Hikes carry emergency communication equipment and have alternate route options for severe weather scenarios.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">For those planning multiple track experiences, consider how different seasons affect various routes. The <a href="https://explorenationalparks.store/track-trail" style="color: #4f7942; font-weight: bold;"><i>track trail</i></a> resources can help compare seasonal conditions across New Zealand's Great Walks network. Proper footwear selection varies by season â€“ <a href="https://explorenationalparks.store/best-running-shoes-for-track-women-s" style="color: #4f7942; font-weight: bold;"><b>women's track running shoes</b></a> and <a href="https://explorenationalparks.store/best-womens-track-shoes" style="color: #4f7942; font-weight: bold;"><i>women's specialized track shoes</i></a> offer different benefits depending on expected conditions.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 25px; border-bottom: 3px solid #4f7942; padding-bottom: 10px;">Conclusion</h2>
    
    <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">Making the Right Choice for Your Adventure</h3>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">After three <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> experiences and extensive research into alternatives, I believe this investment offers unmatched value for most visitors to New Zealand. The combination of professional safety management, educational interpretation, luxury accommodation, and seamless logistics transforms what can be a challenging independent hike into a truly transformative wilderness experience. For international visitors especially, the guided approach eliminates planning complexity while maximizing enjoyment and safety.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">The key decision factors center on budget, hiking experience, and personal preferences for comfort versus challenge. Ultimate Hikes' <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> suits travelers seeking premium wilderness experiences without compromising safety or comfort. Half-day alternatives work well for families or time-constrained visitors, while semi-guided packages appeal to experienced hikers wanting logistical support without full guidance.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">Final Recommendations and Next Steps</h3>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">Book your <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> 12-18 months in advance, particularly for peak season dates. Consider shoulder season bookings for better weather probability and lower costs. Invest in quality waterproof gear and comfortable hiking boots â€“ these make enormous differences in enjoyment and safety. Purchase comprehensive travel insurance given the strict cancellation policies and weather-dependent nature of Fiordland operations.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;">For those planning broader New Zealand hiking adventures, consider combining your <strong>Milford Track guided walk</strong> with other Great Walks like the Routeburn Track or Kepler Track. Fiordland's unique ecosystem and spectacular scenery justify the investment, creating memories that last decades. Whether you choose the luxury guided experience or alternative options, proper preparation and realistic expectations ensure this world-famous track lives up to its reputation as the finest walk in the world.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #2c5530; font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 25px; border-bottom: 3px solid #4f7942; padding-bottom: 10px;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <div style="space-y: 4;">
        <div style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
            <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">How far in advance should I book a Milford Track guided walk?</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 3px solid #4f7942;">Book your Milford Track guided walk 12-18 months in advance, especially for peak season dates (December-March). Ultimate Hikes releases new season bookings around May-June each year, and popular dates sell out within hours. I learned this lesson when attempting to book last-minute for my second trip â€“ ended up waiting an extra year. Shoulder season dates (October-November, March-April) have slightly better availability but still require advance booking. Consider joining Ultimate Hikes' mailing list to receive booking opening notifications.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
            <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">What fitness level is required for the Milford Track guided walk?</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 3px solid #4f7942;">The Milford Track guided walk requires moderate fitness levels suitable for 4-6 hours of daily hiking. While guides set a comfortable pace and provide rest breaks, participants must be capable of walking 10-16 kilometers daily over varied terrain including rocky sections and alpine passes. The most challenging day involves crossing Mackinnon Pass with significant elevation gain and potential weather exposure. I recommend training with regular walks carrying a daypack for 2-3 months before your trip. Most ages from 10-75 can complete the track with adequate preparation and reasonable fitness.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
            <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">What happens if weather conditions are dangerous during the guided walk?</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 3px solid #4f7942;">Professional guide companies like Ultimate Hikes have comprehensive weather management protocols including alternative routes, emergency shelter procedures, and communication systems. During my 2019 trip, severe weather required using the emergency route down from Mackinnon Pass â€“ guides provided constant support and safety equipment throughout the challenging descent. In extreme conditions, helicopter evacuation or extended shelter-in-place may be necessary. Guided operators cannot guarantee perfect weather but provide expert risk management and safety procedures that independent hikers lack. Weather-related delays or route changes don't qualify for refunds under standard policies.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
            <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">Can children participate in Milford Track guided walks?</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 3px solid #4f7942;">Ultimate Hikes accepts children aged 10 and above on Milford Track guided walks, with those under 16 receiving discounted pricing. Children must be capable of hiking the required daily distances and following safety instructions in challenging conditions. Family groups I've encountered generally had positive experiences, though parents should honestly assess their children's hiking abilities and weather tolerance. Half-day options through companies like Trips and Tramps accept children from age 8 and provide a good testing ground for family hiking capabilities. Consider seasonal timing carefully â€“ summer offers the most family-friendly conditions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
            <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">How do guided walks compare to independent hiking on the Milford Track?</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 3px solid #4f7942;">Milford Track guided walks provide luxury accommodation, gourmet meals, professional guides, and comprehensive logistics support, while independent hiking uses basic DOC huts, requires carrying all gear and food, and involves self-navigation and risk management. Guided walks cost NZ$2,829-5,899 compared to independent hiking at around NZ$300-500 total. The guided experience follows a 5-day/4-night itinerary versus 4-day/3-night independent route. Safety support, educational interpretation, and convenience are the primary guided advantages, while independence, cost savings, and flexible pacing favor self-guided options. Weather challenges affect both options, but guided groups have professional risk management support.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
            <h3 style="color: #4f7942; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: 15px;">What should I pack for a Milford Track guided walk?</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1rem; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 3px solid #4f7942;">Essential items include waterproof hiking boots, rain jacket and pants, warm layers (merino wool recommended), quick-dry clothing, hat and gloves, sunglasses, sunscreen, insect repellent with DEET, personal toiletries, medications, and camera equipment. Ultimate Hikes provides 40L backpacks, rain jackets (if requested), and all meals. Avoid cotton clothing entirely due to Fiordland's wet conditions â€“ synthetic or merino wool materials provide better moisture management. Pack light as you'll carry only daily essentials while hiking. A complete packing checklist is provided upon booking, and gear rental options are available in Queenstown for specialized items.</p>
