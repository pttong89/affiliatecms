Founded in 2000 by Federico Marchetti, YOOX revolutionized the fashion industry by creating a platform that connects luxury brands with fashion-conscious consumers seeking authentic designer pieces at accessible prices. Today, as part of the prestigious Net-a-Porter Group, YOOX maintains its position as a trusted source for genuine luxury footwear.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">The platform operates on a unique business model that benefits both designers and customers. Fashion houses partner with YOOX to clear end-of-season inventory, overstock, and previous collections, creating opportunities for consumers to purchase authentic designer shoes at significant discounts. This approach has made <strong>yoox shoes</strong> particularly attractive to fashion enthusiasts who want luxury without the traditional luxury price tags.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">What sets YOOX apart in the crowded online luxury market is its commitment to authenticity and its carefully curated selection. Unlike other platforms that aggregate from multiple sellers, YOOX works directly with brands and authorized dealers, ensuring every pair of shoes sold meets strict authenticity standards. This direct relationship model has built trust among luxury consumers who prioritize genuine products over potential counterfeits.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #28a745; margin: 25px 0;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #28a745; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-check-circle\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Key Advantages of Shopping YOOX Shoes</h3>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0;\">\n<li>Authentic designer footwear from verified sources</li>\n<li>Discounts ranging from 30-80% off retail prices</li>\n<li>Exclusive access to past-season collections</li>\n<li>International shipping with secure payment options</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">The YOOX shopping experience caters specifically to discerning customers who understand luxury fashion. While the website might seem sparse compared to traditional e-commerce sites, this minimalist approach reflects the company's focus on the products themselves rather than flashy marketing. For shoe enthusiasts, this means discovering hidden gems from both established and emerging designers that might otherwise be impossible to find.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"my-experience\" style=\"margin-bottom: 50px;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #2d3748; border-bottom: 3px solid #4a90e2; padding-bottom: 10px;\">My Experience Shopping YOOX Shoes</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://images.vestiairecollective.com/images/resized/w=1246,q=75,f=auto,/produit/black-leather-8-by-yoox-heels-32262956-2_2.jpg\" alt=\"Black leather designer heels from YOOX showcasing the quality and style of luxury footwear available on the platform\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 12px; margin-bottom: 25px;\">\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">Over the past five years, I've purchased more than twenty pairs of <strong>yoox shoes</strong> from various designers, and my experience has been largely positive despite some initial learning curves. My first purchase was a pair of Marni platform sandals that I'd been eyeing at full retail price for months. Finding them on YOOX at 60% off felt like discovering treasure, and when they arrived, I was impressed by both the authenticity and condition.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">The authentication process became clear during my third purchase – a pair of Saint Laurent boots. Every detail matched exactly with the pair I had examined at the brand's flagship store, from the leather quality to the precise stitching patterns. This experience solidified my confidence in YOOX's authenticity guarantees and helped me understand why the platform has maintained such a strong reputation among luxury fashion enthusiasts.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">However, my journey with <strong>yoox shoes</strong> hasn't been without challenges. Sizing proved to be the most significant hurdle, particularly with Italian brands that tend to run smaller than standard US sizing. I learned this lesson the hard way with a pair of Bottega Veneta loafers that arrived a full size too small. The return process was straightforward, though the $6.95 return shipping fee was an unwelcome surprise.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fff3cd 0%, #ffeaa7 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 25px 0; border-left: 4px solid #f39c12;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #d68910; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Personal Shopping Strategy</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0; font-style: italic;\">\"I always check measurements provided in the product details and cross-reference with my own foot measurements. When in doubt, I contact YOOX customer service – they're surprisingly knowledgeable about specific items and can provide additional sizing guidance based on other customers' feedback.\"</p>\n</div>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">One of my most memorable purchases was a pair of limited-edition Balenciaga sneakers that I'd missed during their initial release. Discovering them on YOOX months later felt serendipitous, and they became a conversation starter everywhere I wore them. This experience highlighted one of YOOX's unique advantages – access to pieces that are no longer available through traditional retail channels.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">The customer service experience has been consistently professional, though response times can vary during peak sale periods. When I received a damaged box (though the shoes inside were perfect), YOOX immediately offered a partial refund without requiring a return. This flexibility demonstrated their commitment to customer satisfaction and helped build my long-term loyalty to the platform.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"designer-brands\" style=\"margin-bottom: 50px;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #2d3748; border-bottom: 3px solid #4a90e2; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Top Designer Brands Available on YOOX</h2>\n\n<div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr)); gap: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff; padding: 25px; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #4a90e2; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-crown\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Luxury Heritage Brands</h3>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><strong>Saint Laurent:</strong> Iconic pumps, boots, and sneakers</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><strong>Balenciaga:</strong> Statement sneakers and architectural heels</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><strong>Bottega Veneta:</strong> Signature woven leather styles</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><strong>Prada:</strong> Classic loafers and contemporary designs</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff; padding: 25px; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #4a90e2; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-gem\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Contemporary Designers</h3>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><strong>Marni:</strong> Artistic prints and bold silhouettes</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><strong>Maison Margiela:</strong> Deconstructed and avant-garde styles</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><strong>Rick Owens:</strong> Gothic and architectural footwear</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><strong>Off-White:</strong> Streetwear-inspired luxury sneakers</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">The selection of <strong>yoox shoes</strong> represents a carefully curated mix of established luxury houses and innovative contemporary designers. What consistently impresses me is the depth of each brand's representation – you'll find everything from signature pieces that define a designer's aesthetic to experimental styles that showcase their creative evolution. This diversity makes YOOX particularly valuable for fashion enthusiasts who want to explore beyond mainstream offerings.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ\" style=\"border-radius: 12px; margin: 25px 0;\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">Italian brands dominate the YOOX shoe selection, reflecting both the platform's origins and the country's reputation for exceptional footwear craftsmanship. Designers like <b>Marni</b> and <i>Bottega Veneta</i> consistently offer some of the most compelling pieces, often featuring innovative materials and construction techniques that justify their luxury positioning. These brands also tend to have the most significant markdowns, making them excellent entry points for newcomers to luxury footwear.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background: #e8f5e8; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 25px 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0; font-size: 1.05rem;\"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Check out these shoe care essentials to maintain your designer YOOX purchases: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XYZABC1?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"color: #4a90e2; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 500;\" rel=\"nofollow\">Premium Leather Shoe Care Kit</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QRSTUV2?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"color: #4a90e2; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 500;\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cedar Shoe Trees</a> for proper storage.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">Emerging and niche designers also find strong representation on YOOX, often providing the most surprising discoveries. These lesser-known brands frequently offer exceptional value propositions, combining innovative design with accessible pricing even before YOOX's discounts. I've found some of my most complimented pairs from these emerging talents, proving that the platform's curatorial vision extends beyond just marquee names.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"authenticity-quality\" style=\"margin-bottom: 50px;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #2d3748; border-bottom: 3px solid #4a90e2; padding-bottom: 10px;\">YOOX Shoes Authenticity and Quality</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.yoox.com/images/items/17/17999988NQ_14_d.jpg\" alt=\"Detailed view of authentic designer sneaker showing quality construction and materials available through YOOX luxury footwear platform\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 12px; margin-bottom: 25px;\">\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">Authenticity concerns naturally arise when shopping discounted luxury goods, but YOOX has built its reputation on providing genuine designer products. The platform's authentication process involves multiple checkpoints, from initial sourcing through direct brand relationships to final quality control before shipping. Every pair of <strong>yoox shoes</strong> I've purchased has passed my personal authenticity verification, including comparisons with items from official brand boutiques.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">The quality control standards become evident in the packaging and presentation of YOOX orders. Items arrive in branded boxes with all original accessories, dust bags, and authenticity cards when applicable. The attention to detail in preserving the complete brand experience demonstrates YOOX's commitment to maintaining the integrity of luxury purchases, even at discounted prices.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background: #f0f8ff; padding: 25px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #0066cc; margin: 25px 0;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #0066cc; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-shield-alt\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Authentication Verification Points</h3>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Serial numbers and authentication cards match brand standards</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Materials, stitching, and hardware meet luxury quality benchmarks</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Packaging includes all original brand elements</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Construction details align with official brand specifications</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">Independent authentication services have consistently verified the genuineness of YOOX purchases when customers seek third-party confirmation. Professional authenticators praise the platform's consistent sourcing standards and note that the discounted prices reflect the clearance nature of inventory rather than any compromise in authenticity. This external validation provides additional confidence for cautious luxury consumers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">Quality assessment of <strong>yoox shoes</strong> reveals that condition standards remain high despite the clearance model. Items typically arrive in excellent condition, with any minor imperfections clearly disclosed in product descriptions. The transparency in condition reporting helps set appropriate expectations and reduces post-purchase disappointment. For shoe storage and organization, consider investing in a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MNOPQRS?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"color: #4a90e2; text-decoration: none;\" rel=\"nofollow\">luxury shoe cabinet</a> to protect your designer investments.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">The platform's relationship with brands extends beyond simple inventory clearing to include quality oversight and brand protection initiatives. This partnership approach ensures that YOOX maintains the high standards expected by luxury fashion houses while providing consumers with authentic products at accessible prices. The mutual benefit of this relationship model contributes to the long-term sustainability of the platform's authenticity guarantees.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"shopping-tips\" style=\"margin-bottom: 50px;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #2d3748; border-bottom: 3px solid #4a90e2; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Shopping Tips and Sizing Guide</h2>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">Mastering the art of shopping <strong>yoox shoes</strong> requires understanding the unique aspects of the platform and developing strategies for successful purchases. The most crucial skill involves interpreting size information across different international sizing systems and designer-specific variations. Italian brands particularly require careful attention, as they often run smaller than standard US sizing conventions.</p>\n\n<div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr)); gap: 20px; margin: 30px 0;\">\n\n<div style=\"background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); color: white; padding: 25px; border-radius: 12px;\">\n<h3 style=\"margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: 600;\"><i class=\"fas fa-ruler\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Sizing Strategy</h3>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0; padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.8;\">\n<li>Always check product measurements, not just size labels</li>\n<li>Italian/EU sizes typically run 1-2 sizes smaller than US</li>\n<li>Read customer reviews for brand-specific sizing notes</li>\n<li>When in doubt, contact customer service for guidance</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f093fb 0%, #f5576c 100%); color: white; padding: 25px; border-radius: 12px;\">\n<h3 style=\"margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: 600;\"><i class=\"fas fa-search\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Finding Deals</h3>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0; padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.8;\">\n<li>Check the sale section regularly for new markdowns</li>\n<li>Sign up for newsletter alerts on specific brands</li>\n<li>End-of-season sales offer the deepest discounts</li>\n<li>Follow YOOX social media for flash sale announcements</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">The seasonal shopping calendar plays a crucial role in maximizing value on YOOX. End-of-season clearances typically occur in January-February for fall/winter items and July-August for spring/summer collections. These periods offer the deepest discounts on <strong>yoox shoes</strong>, but also require patience as popular sizes sell out quickly. Planning purchases around these cycles can result in significant savings.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">Payment and shipping considerations deserve careful attention when shopping internationally. YOOX offers multiple payment options including PayPal, which provides additional buyer protection for returns. International shipping costs vary by location but often include customs handling, making the total cost calculation important for budget planning.

Always check the actual measurements provided in the product details, and when possible, compare with shoes you already own from the same brand.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">Return policies require strategic consideration when shopping YOOX. The 14-day return window begins upon delivery, and the $6.95 return shipping fee applies to all returns. Planning purchases with adequate time for evaluation and potential exchanges helps avoid rushed decisions. Some customers use PayPal's return shipping reimbursement program, though availability varies by region and purchase timing.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">Building a relationship with YOOX customer service can provide valuable shopping assistance. Representatives often have access to additional product information, sizing guidance from other customers, and insights into upcoming sales or restocks. Their knowledge about specific designer sizing tendencies has proven invaluable for avoiding sizing mistakes on subsequent purchases.

The key appears to be treating YOOX shopping as a skill that improves with experience rather than expecting the simplified shopping experience of traditional retail.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.05rem;\">Professional fashion industry feedback reinforces the authenticity and quality aspects of YOOX purchases.

YOOX has direct relationships with designers, manufacturers, and official dealers, ensuring all products sold are genuine. The company is part of the prestigious Net-a-Porter Group and has built its reputation on authenticity. Every item undergoes quality verification before shipping, and YOOX provides authenticity guarantees. Their authentication process includes checking serial numbers, materials, craftsmanship, and packaging details. Many customers, including myself, have verified authenticity by comparing purchases with items from official brand stores.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); overflow: hidden;\">\n<h3 style=\"background: #4a90e2; color: white; padding: 20px; margin: 0; font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600;\">Why are YOOX shoes so cheap compared to retail?</h3>\n<div style=\"padding: 20px;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0; line-height: 1.6;\">YOOX shoes are discounted because they primarily sell end-of-season inventory, overstock, and previous collections from luxury brands. This clearance model allows them to offer genuine designer shoes at 30-80% off retail prices. The company works directly with fashion houses to clear their excess inventory, creating a win-win situation. Additionally, YOOX operates with lower overhead costs than traditional luxury retail stores, passing savings to customers. The sparse product descriptions and limited photos also reduce operational costs, contributing to lower prices while maintaining product authenticity.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); overflow: hidden;\">\n<h3 style=\"background: #4a90e2; color: white; padding: 20px; margin: 0; font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600;\">How does YOOX sizing compare to regular shoe sizes?</h3>\n<div style=\"padding: 20px;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0; line-height: 1.6;\">YOOX sizing can be tricky because different designers have varying size standards. Italian brands like Marni and Bottega Veneta often run small, while some contemporary designers run true to size. I always check the product measurements provided rather than relying solely on size labels. European sizes (IT/EU) are most common on YOOX and typically run smaller than US sizes. For example, a US size 8 usually corresponds to IT 38-39. Many users report sizing inconsistencies even within the same brand, so I recommend studying reviews and measurements carefully before purchasing.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); overflow: hidden;\">\n<h3 style=\"background: #4a90e2; color: white; padding: 20px; margin: 0; font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600;\">What is YOOX return policy for shoes?</h3>\n<div style=\"padding: 20px;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0; line-height: 1.6;\">YOOX offers returns within 14 days of delivery for a full refund, minus a $6.95 return shipping fee. Items must be unworn and in original packaging with all tags attached. The return process involves printing a prepaid shipping label and sending items back via UPS. Processing typically takes 5-7 business days after YOOX receives the return. Some customers report keeping sales tax as a 'return fee,' though this varies by location. PayPal purchases can sometimes get return shipping reimbursed through PayPal's buyer protection, though this program has limitations.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"background: #ffffff; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); overflow: hidden;\">\n<h3 style=\"background: #4a90e2; color: white; padding: 20px; margin: 0; font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600;\">Which designer shoe brands are available on YOOX?</h3>\n<div style=\"padding: 20px;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0; line-height: 1.6;\">YOOX carries an extensive range of luxury designer shoe brands including Balenciaga, Saint Laurent, Marni, Maison Margiela, Bottega Veneta, Prada, Gucci, Off-White, Rick Owens, and many others. The selection varies seasonally but consistently features top-tier Italian and international designers. You'll find everything from statement sneakers to elegant heels, boots, and loafers. Emerging designers and contemporary brands are also well-represented alongside heritage luxury houses. The inventory changes frequently, so I recommend checking regularly for new arrivals from your favorite brands.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</section>\n\n<footer style=\"background: #2d3748; color: white; padding: 30px; border-radius: 12px; text-align: center; margin-top: 50px;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0; font-size: 1.05rem;\">Explore more designer footwear guides: <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/birdies-shoes\" style=\"color: #81e6d9; text-decoration: none;\"><b>Birdies shoes</b></a> | <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/blazers-shoes\" style=\"color: #81e6d9; text-decoration: none;\"><i>Blazers shoes</i></a> | <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/bobs-shoes\" style=\"color: #81e6d9; text-decoration: none;\"><b>BOBS shoes</b></a> | <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/boxer-shoes\" style=\"color: #81e6d9; text-decoration: none;\"><i>Boxer shoes</i></a> | <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/cariuma-shoes\" style=\"color: #81e6d9; text-decoration: none;\"><b>Cariuma shoes</b></a> | <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/cheerleading-shoes\" style=\"color: #81e6d9; text-decoration: none;\"><i>Cheerleading shoes</i></a></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 15px 0 0 0; font-size: 0.95rem; opacity: 0.8;\">Additional Resources: <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/chucks-shoes\" style=\"color: #81e6d9; text-decoration: none;\"><b>Chucks shoes</b></a> | <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/cloudnova-shoes\" style=\"color: #81e6d9; text-decoration: none;\"><i>CloudNova shoes</i></a> | <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/clove-shoes\" style=\"color: #81e6d9; text-decoration: none;\"><b>Clove shoes</b></a> | <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/creepers-shoes\" style=\"color: #81e6d9; text-decoration: none;\"><i>Creepers shoes</i></a> | <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/d-and-g-shoes\" style=\"color: #81e6d9; text-decoration: none;\"><b>D&amp;G shoes</b></a> | <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/yoox-shoes\" style=\"color: #81e6d9; text-decoration: none;\"><i>YOOX shoes guide</i></a></p>\n</footer>\n\n</div>\n\n<script defer=\"\" src=\"https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js/vcd15cbe7772f49c399c6a5babf22c1241717689176015\" integrity=\"sha512-ZpsOmlRQV6y907TI0dKBHq9Md29nnaEIPlkf84rnaERnq6zvWvPUqr2ft8M1aS28oN72PdrCzSjY4U6VaAw1EQ==\" data-cf-beacon=\"{&quot;rayId&quot;:&quot;96c358233f171c66&quot;,&quot;serverTiming&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:{&quot;cfExtPri&quot;:true,&quot;cfEdge&quot;:true,&quot;cfOrigin&quot;:true,&quot;cfL4&quot;:true,&quot;cfSpeedBrain&quot;:true,&quot;cfCacheStatus&quot;:true}},&quot;version&quot;:&quot;2025.7.0&quot;,&quot;token&quot;:&quot;4edd5f8ec12a48cfa682ab8261b80a79&quot;}\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n\n    <script id=\"html_badge_script1\">\n        window.__genspark_remove_badge_link = \"\" +\n            \"remove_badge?token=To%2FBnjzloZ3UfQdcSaYfDv9LmF8iH3VP6k0RY%2BbeyuTmUoDmjHmdHxCqSsGSJbZ4nXPaN3NZqXewpCw61U5YAJ%2BXdDFDU3VpMXYCwN5Ai67j3cLs33KWCHqJNaWRFiIhD0%2B6FRB3lOYya7mnU66%2BqT9VhSfpKHueZHGLEaRkHGAj87O%2FZ27mnEEDaePydsN2Ahev5wspeL0S0%2BYI4ySeb0tCsk230GutMk3xlvi1Qo38wiKbvPYQ%2FDzEEgPh3Ny8p5TTDVzxvu0m6UQlVSOSnIW0MhT2mjHNtogjlhhplJb7qv0VzIfORh%2F5VNeUaZcqjkJ3WSzWrAEXeBLk0MWBjXMYfCCnzJMcRoEgkrfIB%2BWt%2Bwl6YXTKTR0XzZrD5x5bbYTy%2F62G46VxJzAGmFurMC90qqiZOkFdHyAv0SFeTTrgfDX06QsvhJRQHNDm8W914hNA%2BunDvYXHc%2FYjhFng7Jlww5nRMe3FCxfcB8johzSl3CQQ2zh4mrLzxlmzau5qqKCkxK%2FrJZy4zHOLxFfaiciIcdtyud9XMa%2B7hygCGHY%3D\";\n        window.__genspark_locale = \"en-US\";\n        window.__genspark_token = \"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\";\n    </script>\n    \n        <script id=\"html_badge_script2\" src=\"\"></script>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n        \n    <script id=\"html_notice_dialog_script\" src=\"\"></script>"
