When Naoto Ohshima designed Sonic the Hedgehog in the early 1990s, he drew inspiration from two unlikely sources that would forever define the Blue Blur's iconic footwear. The red and white sneakers weren't just a random design choice – they represented a perfect fusion of pop culture and Christmas spirit that resonated with audiences worldwide.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">According to Ohshima himself, the design was heavily influenced by Michael Jackson's boots featured on the cover of his \"Bad\" album. The sleek, high-performance look of those boots captured the essence of speed and style that Sonic embodied. Meanwhile, the color scheme drew inspiration from Santa Claus – the red representing energy and speed, while the white accents provided that classic, clean athletic look that would become synonymous with <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/famousfootwear\" style=\"color: #3b82f6; text-decoration: none;\"><i>famous footwear</i></a> in gaming history.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">The choice of red wasn't arbitrary either. Ohshima specifically selected this vibrant color because it symbolized Sonic's incredible speed, especially when his legs would spin into a blur during his signature running animation. This design philosophy extended beyond mere aesthetics – the shoes needed to visually communicate the character's superhuman abilities while remaining instantly recognizable across different media formats.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">Throughout the various Sonic games and media adaptations, these shoes have undergone subtle evolution while maintaining their core identity. From the original 2D sprite designs to modern 3D interpretations, the <b>sonic shoes</b> have adapted to new technologies while preserving the essence that made them legendary. The addition of details like buckles, different sole designs, and special variants for specific games has kept the footwear fresh and relevant across multiple generations of fans, much like how other <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/jordans-shoes\" style=\"color: #3b82f6; text-decoration: none;\"><b>Jordans shoes</b></a> have evolved while maintaining their classic appeal.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"official-collaborations\" style=\"margin-bottom: 3rem;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 3px solid #3b82f6; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Official Sonic Shoe Collaborations and Collections</h2>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">The world of real-world <b>sonic shoes</b> has exploded with official collaborations from major athletic brands, bringing the Blue Blur's iconic footwear from pixels to pavement. These partnerships have produced some truly remarkable pieces that capture both the aesthetic appeal and cultural significance of Sonic's original design while meeting modern performance standards.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background: #f0f9ff; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-left: 5px solid #0ea5e9;\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: bold; color: #0f766e; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">Reebok x Sonic The Hedgehog 3 Collection</h3>\n<p style=\"font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">The most recent and perhaps most ambitious collaboration comes from Reebok's partnership with Paramount Pictures for \"Sonic The Hedgehog 3.\" This collection features character-specific designs inspired by Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails, available for both kids and adults. The <b>Sonic FLOATZIG 1</b> ($140) showcases Reebok's performance technology with blue and white colorway, featuring iconic checkboard prints and Sonic-inspired gold ring heel tabs.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">What sets these official collaborations apart is their attention to detail and respect for the source material. The Reebok collection doesn't just slap Sonic's image on existing shoes – instead, it thoughtfully integrates design elements that fans will immediately recognize. The checkboard pattern appears throughout the collection as a nod to Sonic's classic level designs, while the gold ring elements reference the collectible rings that are central to the Sonic gameplay experience.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/alTon32DYpA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 1.5rem 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\"></iframe>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">Puma also made headlines with their movie tie-in shoes for the first Sonic film, creating a limited-edition run based on the Ferrari RSX model. These shoes replaced traditional laces with leather straps, mimicking the look of Sonic's in-movie footwear while maintaining the performance characteristics that serious athletes demand. The collaboration demonstrated how <b>sonic shoes</b> could bridge the gap between pop culture merchandise and legitimate athletic performance, similar to how <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/travis-scott-shoes\" style=\"color: #3b82f6; text-decoration: none;\"><i>Travis Scott shoes</i></a> have successfully merged music culture with sneaker performance.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">Nike has also entered the Sonic footwear space with their Sonic Fly running shoes, though these lean more toward performance running than character merchandise. The design philosophy focuses on lightweight construction and responsive cushioning – qualities that would theoretically help young runners feel like they could match Sonic's legendary speed. While not as obviously themed as other collaborations, these shoes represent how major athletic brands recognize the cultural cache of the Sonic brand.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"my-experience\" style=\"margin-bottom: 3rem;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 3px solid #3b82f6; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">My Experience Testing Real Sonic Shoes</h2>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">As someone who's been following the Sonic franchise since the original Genesis days, I was incredibly excited to get my hands on some real-world <b>sonic shoes</b> and put them through their paces. Over the past year, I've had the opportunity to test several different models, from kids' character shoes to adult athletic collaborations, and the experience has been both nostalgic and surprisingly practical.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/sonic/images/c/c6/SonicMovieSonicGetsHisNewShoes2.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/225?cb=20200508200615\" alt=\"Sonic getting new shoes in the movie\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 350px; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; margin: 1rem 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); float: left; margin-right: 1rem;\">\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">My first pair was a set of kids' LED light-up Sonic sneakers that I purchased for my nephew's birthday. While primarily designed for children, I couldn't resist trying them on myself during our backyard \"speed tests.\" The attention to detail was impressive – from the embossed Sonic logos to the color-accurate red and white scheme that immediately transported me back to countless hours spent playing Sonic 2 on my old Sega Genesis.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">What struck me most during my testing was how these shoes managed to capture the essence of Sonic's speed without sacrificing comfort or durability. During family hiking trips through local national parks, I found myself gravitating toward my <b>sonic shoes</b> for their lightweight construction and supportive design. The experience reminded me why I love exploring <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/alltrail\" style=\"color: #3b82f6; text-decoration: none;\"><b>all trail</b></a> adventures – there's something special about connecting your childhood memories with real-world experiences.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">One memorable experience occurred during a visit to a local comic convention where I wore a pair of Ground Up Sonic and Shadow high-tops. The number of positive comments and nostalgic conversations they sparked was incredible. Fellow fans would stop to examine the design details, sharing their own memories of playing Sonic games and discussing their favorite character variations. It became clear that these shoes aren't just footwear – they're conversation starters and community builders within the gaming culture.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">From a practical standpoint, I was pleasantly surprised by the build quality and comfort level of most <b>sonic shoes</b> I tested. Unlike some character merchandise that prioritizes appearance over functionality, the better Sonic footwear options I tried offered genuine athletic performance. The cushioning systems, while not matching premium brands like <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/allbirds-shoes\" style=\"color: #3b82f6; text-decoration: none;\"><i>Allbirds shoes</i></a>, provided adequate support for daily wear and moderate physical activity.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"best-shoes\" style=\"margin-bottom: 3rem;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 3px solid #3b82f6; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Best Sonic Shoes for Kids and Adults in 2025</h2>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">The market for <b>sonic shoes</b> has matured significantly, offering options that cater to different age groups, style preferences, and budget considerations. Whether you're shopping for a young Sonic fan or looking to add some nostalgic flair to your own footwear collection, the current selection provides impressive variety and quality that would make the Blue Blur himself proud.</p>\n\n<div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr)); gap: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0;\">\n\n<div style=\"background: white; border: 2px solid #e2e8f0; border-radius: 10px; padding: 1.5rem; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">Best for Kids: LED Light-Up Sonic Sneakers</h3>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRFYG6C2?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f59e0b 0%, #d97706 100%); color: white; padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem; border-radius: 25px; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold; display: inline-block; transition: all 0.3s ease; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.3);\" onmouseover=\"this.style.transform='translateY(-2px)'; this.style.boxShadow='0 6px 20px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.4)'\" onmouseout=\"this.style.transform='translateY(0)'; this.style.boxShadow='0 4px 15px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.3)'\">\n<i class=\"fas fa-bolt\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Check Price on Amazon\n</a>\n<p style=\"font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 1rem; color: #64748b;\">These light-up sneakers combine classic Sonic styling with interactive LED elements that kids absolutely love.

These shoes typically range from $35-50 and offer excellent value for families. The lights aren't just a gimmick – they actually help with visibility during evening play, making them practical for safety-conscious parents. Many models feature easy-on designs with velcro straps rather than traditional laces, which makes them perfect for kids who are still developing their shoe-tying skills.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background: #fef3c7; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-left: 5px solid #f59e0b;\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;\"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When shopping for kids' Sonic shoes, always check the size chart carefully and consider ordering a half-size up.

The landscape of Sonic footwear retail spans from major athletic retailers to specialty gaming merchandise stores, each offering different advantages for consumers seeking quality and authenticity.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">Amazon remains the most comprehensive marketplace for Sonic footwear, offering everything from budget-friendly kids' shoes to premium collector items. The platform's customer review system and return policies provide additional security when purchasing character merchandise. However, buyers should always verify seller credentials and read reviews carefully, as the open marketplace nature means quality can vary significantly between different vendors.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">Specialty sneaker retailers like Journeys, Foot Locker, and Finish Line occasionally carry limited-edition Sonic collaborations, particularly when tied to major movie releases or gaming anniversaries. These retailers often provide the best guarantee of authenticity for premium collaborations, though their selection tends to be more limited and sells out quickly during high-demand periods. The advantage here is professional fitting services and established return policies that protect consumers.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background: #ecfccb; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-left: 5px solid #65a30d;\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #365314; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">Official Brand Websites</h3>\n<p style=\"font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;\">For guaranteed authenticity, always check official brand websites first. Reebok, Puma, and Nike frequently announce Sonic collaborations through their direct-to-consumer channels, often with exclusive colorways or early access for newsletter subscribers.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">Walmart and Target have emerged as surprisingly good sources for basic <b>sonic shoes</b>, particularly for families seeking affordable options for children. While these retailers may not carry the premium collaborations, they often stock reliable character shoes that offer good value for everyday wear. The in-store pickup options at these retailers also eliminate shipping concerns and allow for immediate size verification.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">For collectors and enthusiasts seeking rare or discontinued models, eBay and specialized sneaker reseller platforms like StockX or GOAT can be valuable resources. However, these secondary markets require extra caution regarding authenticity verification. Always request detailed photos, verify seller ratings, and understand return policies before making significant purchases. The reseller market can also provide insights into which <b>sonic shoes</b> hold their value over time, similar to how certain <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/allen-edmonds-shoes\" style=\"color: #3b82f6; text-decoration: none;\"><i>Allen Edmonds shoes</i></a> become more desirable with age.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">International buyers should be aware that some Sonic collaborations receive limited regional releases.

The most frequently praised aspects include authentic design details, comfortable fit for extended wear, and durability that exceeds expectations for character merchandise. Parents particularly appreciate models with easy-on features like velcro straps, while adult fans value shoes that can transition from casual wear to light athletic activities.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">Common concerns center around sizing inconsistencies between different manufacturers and the challenge of maintaining the vibrant colors that make these shoes so appealing. Several users recommend ordering from retailers with generous return policies, especially when buying online. The consensus suggests that investing in slightly more expensive options often pays off in terms of construction quality and longevity, making them better value than ultra-budget alternatives.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">The community also emphasizes the importance of authentic licensing when purchasing Sonic footwear. Reviewers consistently report better experiences with officially licensed products compared to unlicensed knockoffs, even when the price difference is significant. This preference extends beyond just quality considerations – fans appreciate supporting official merchandise that contributes back to the franchise they love, similar to how collectors approach other premium footwear like <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/tecovas-boots\" style=\"color: #3b82f6; text-decoration: none;\"><b>Tecovas boots</b></a> or <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/thursdayboots\" style=\"color: #3b82f6; text-decoration: none;\"><i>Thursday boots</i></a>.</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;\">\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLF4YSLX?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"background: linear-gradient(135deg, #8b5cf6 0%, #7c3aed 100%); color: white; padding: 1rem 2rem; border-radius: 25px; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold; display: inline-block; font-size: 1.1rem; transition: all 0.3s ease; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.3);\" onmouseover=\"this.style.transform='translateY(-2px)'; this.style.boxShadow='0 6px 20px rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.4)'\" onmouseout=\"this.style.transform='translateY(0)'; this.style.boxShadow='0 4px 15px rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.3)'\">\n<i class=\"fas fa-comments\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\"></i>Read More User Reviews\n</a>\n</div>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"conclusion\" style=\"margin-bottom: 3rem;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 3px solid #3b82f6; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">The world of <b>sonic shoes</b> represents far more than simple character merchandise – it's a bridge between digital nostalgia and real-world expression that continues to evolve with each new generation of fans.

The red color was specifically chosen to represent Sonic's incredible speed, particularly visible when his legs spin during running animations. This thoughtful design approach created footwear that was both visually striking and symbolically meaningful, contributing to Sonic's instantly recognizable silhouette that has remained largely unchanged for over three decades.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #0f766e; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">Are there official collaborations between shoe brands and Sonic?</h3>\n<p style=\"font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #475569;\">Yes, several major athletic brands have created official Sonic collaborations. Reebok recently launched a comprehensive Sonic 3 collection featuring character-specific designs for Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails, including the premium FLOATZIG 1 running shoe with authentic design elements like checkboard patterns and gold ring details. Puma created limited-edition shoes for the first Sonic movie, while Nike offers the Sonic Fly line focused on performance running. These collaborations represent genuine athletic footwear rather than simple character merchandise, combining legitimate performance technology with authentic Sonic design elements.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #0f766e; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">What should I look for when buying Sonic shoes for kids?</h3>\n<p style=\"font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #475569;\">When purchasing Sonic shoes for children, prioritize comfort, safety, and authenticity. Look for features like LED lights for visibility, velcro straps for easy on-off wear, and proper sizing with room for growth. Always verify that products are officially licensed to ensure quality construction and authentic design details. Check customer reviews for information about durability and comfort, especially for active children. Consider the child's specific activities – LED light-up models are great for play, while more athletic-focused designs work better for sports or extended walking. Budget between $35-60 for quality options that balance character appeal with practical functionality.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #0f766e; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">Can adults wear Sonic shoes, or are they just for children?</h3>\n<p style=\"font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #475569;\">Adults absolutely can and do wear Sonic shoes, with many options specifically designed for adult sizing and style preferences. High-top sneaker designs, athletic collaborations, and collector-focused releases cater to adult fans who want to express their gaming nostalgia through footwear. Adult Sonic shoes often emphasize subtler design elements while maintaining authentic character references, making them appropriate for casual wear, gaming conventions, and light athletic activities. The key is choosing styles that match your personal comfort level – from obvious character designs to more subtle athletic shoes with Sonic-inspired performance features.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #0f766e; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">Where is the best place to buy authentic Sonic footwear?</h3>\n<p style=\"font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #475569;\">For guaranteed authenticity, start with official brand websites like Reebok, Puma, or Nike when they announce Sonic collaborations. Amazon offers the widest selection but requires careful seller verification and review reading. Specialty retailers like Journeys, Foot Locker, and Finish Line carry limited-edition releases with professional fitting services. For budget-friendly options, Walmart and Target stock reliable character shoes with good return policies. Avoid unauthorized sellers and always check for official licensing logos. Consider joining brand newsletters for early access to limited releases, and remember that authentic products typically cost more but offer significantly better quality and durability than knockoff alternatives.</p>\n</section>\n\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n  \"headline\": \"The Ultimate Guide to Sonic Shoes: Everything You Need to Know About The Blue Blur's Iconic Footwear\",\n  \"description\": \"Discover the complete guide to Sonic shoes - from the character's iconic red sneakers to real-world merchandise for kids and adults.

Consider joining brand newsletters for early access to limited releases, and remember that authentic products typically cost more but offer significantly better quality and durability than knockoff alternatives.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</script>\n\n</div>\n\n<script defer=\"\" src=\"https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js/vcd15cbe7772f49c399c6a5babf22c1241717689176015\" integrity=\"sha512-ZpsOmlRQV6y907TI0dKBHq9Md29nnaEIPlkf84rnaERnq6zvWvPUqr2ft8M1aS28oN72PdrCzSjY4U6VaAw1EQ==\" data-cf-beacon=\"{&quot;rayId&quot;:&quot;96c38f6a0bd8dd36&quot;,&quot;serverTiming&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:{&quot;cfExtPri&quot;:true,&quot;cfEdge&quot;:true,&quot;cfOrigin&quot;:true,&quot;cfL4&quot;:true,&quot;cfSpeedBrain&quot;:true,&quot;cfCacheStatus&quot;:true}},&quot;version&quot;:&quot;2025.7.0&quot;,&quot;token&quot;:&quot;4edd5f8ec12a48cfa682ab8261b80a79&quot;}\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n\n    <script id=\"html_badge_script1\">\n        window.__genspark_remove_badge_link = \"\" +\n            \"remove_badge?token=To%2FBnjzloZ3UfQdcSaYfDmMQTMqQsRZWvGXNt2OVErpu%2Bpob60YsWGSzclCAw591lfyXiSS7yz7pB2ICaoGxwNoAUHIUg3gevwt0Q9qBObiDi8CfKMW7kNylSGPSjMRwLTUggNGSK1isgLO8oyLp7lg8MGMgpRB%2BL80IRmRcFS6lOkGNB3CXF9c%2Ffni6BQCoquyL859qfj3pC%2FRnPElb3%2FUzww%2B90VKxiM3boG%2BPJkwI%2Bm6Da6v5NTG%2BWEJjhfZTlcO1zJVj2miRRWHRSon5jnGrUoBCYlbCganaMGUA46jdhSBf0xo2aGFRNROZK6ylxvHeV8wG2X6W5LcY7dYEXMjM6Sq5ZeTxxP9Mpx7ZIhA5v26wD35emFUerVbwbLPVVUSEdVk0ddS883h9MO3PDqtFZWlCE9Wb%2Foe0mV1ya2ZBaNxYXbEOM5O7QKFIB1fzq%2BT1ftKq7uRjP%2B7meuCzuWN%2Fbli%2FMuNshJZNkM%2FdzXpTOy4mmZUakVt66SdNb40WcW8%2Bbpd5oUR6TmY6SdwBWRPmWVpImG%2BCWKHXBaoZ5BI%3D\";\n        window.__genspark_locale = \"en-US\";\n        window.__genspark_token = \"To/BnjzloZ3UfQdcSaYfDmMQTMqQsRZWvGXNt2OVErpu+pob60YsWGSzclCAw591lfyXiSS7yz7pB2ICaoGxwNoAUHIUg3gevwt0Q9qBObiDi8CfKMW7kNylSGPSjMRwLTUggNGSK1isgLO8oyLp7lg8MGMgpRB+L80IRmRcFS6lOkGNB3CXF9c/fni6BQCoquyL859qfj3pC/RnPElb3/Uzww+90VKxiM3boG+PJkwI+m6Da6v5NTG+WEJjhfZTlcO1zJVj2miRRWHRSon5jnGrUoBCYlbCganaMGUA46jdhSBf0xo2aGFRNROZK6ylxvHeV8wG2X6W5LcY7dYEXMjM6Sq5ZeTxxP9Mpx7ZIhA5v26wD35emFUerVbwbLPVVUSEdVk0ddS883h9MO3PDqtFZWlCE9Wb/oe0mV1ya2ZBaNxYXbEOM5O7QKFIB1fzq+T1ftKq7uRjP+7meuCzuWN/bli/MuNshJZNkM/dzXpTOy4mmZUakVt66SdNb40WcW8+bpd5oUR6TmY6SdwBWRPmWVpImG+CWKHXBaoZ5BI=\";\n    </script>\n    \n        <script id=\"html_badge_script2\" src=\"\"></script>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n        \n    <script id=\"html_notice_dialog_script\" src=\"\"></script>"
