Conner, a local mountain guide who hiked to this rocky outcrop in the 1920s with renowned conservationist Horace Kephart. Legend tells us that when Conner removed his worn boots during a rest stop, Kephart noticed his prominent bunion and remarked that the surrounding rocks resembled it. True to his word, Kephart successfully lobbied to have \"Charlies Bunion\" officially placed on government maps.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                \n                <div style=\"background: #f7fafc; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; border: 2px solid #e2e8f0;\">\n                    <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2d5016; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Quick Facts</h3>\n                    <ul style=\"list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;\">\n                        <li style=\"padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e2e8f0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-map-marker-alt\" style=\"color: #4a7c59; width: 20px;\"></i> Elevation: 5,528 feet</li>\n                        <li style=\"padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e2e8f0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-route\" style=\"color: #4a7c59; width: 20px;\"></i> Distance: 8.1 miles roundtrip</li>\n                        <li style=\"padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e2e8f0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-chart-line\" style=\"color: #4a7c59; width: 20px;\"></i> Elevation Gain: 1,640 feet</li>\n                        <li style=\"padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e2e8f0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-clock\" style=\"color: #4a7c59; width: 20px;\"></i> Duration: 4-6 hours</li>\n                        <li style=\"padding: 8px 0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-paw\" style=\"color: #4a7c59; width: 20px;\"></i> Dogs: Not permitted</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            \n            <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify;\">\n                The dramatic rock formation itself resulted from a devastating wildfire in 1925, followed by subsequent erosion that exposed the underlying Anakeesta Formation.

This large paved parking lot sits at 5,046 feet elevation and serves as the trailhead for several popular hikes, including the Appalachian Trail sections leading to charlies bunion.\n            </p>\n            \n            <div style=\"background: #fff5f5; border-left: 5px solid #f56565; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 25px;\">\n                <h3 style=\"color: #c53030; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: bold;\">\n                    <i class=\"fas fa-exclamation-triangle\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Important Parking Information\n                </h3>\n                <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n                    Since 2023, Great Smoky Mountains National Park requires <strong>paid parking tags</strong> for stays longer than 15 minutes. You can purchase daily ($5), weekly ($15), or annual ($40) tags at the visitor center or online. The parking lot fills quickly during peak seasons, so I strongly recommend arriving before 8:00 AM.\n                </p>\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;\">\n                    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hiking-Great-Smoky-Mountains-National/dp/1493056692?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"background: #4a7c59; color: white; padding: 12px 25px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 8px; font-weight: bold; display: inline-block;\">\n                        <i class=\"fas fa-book\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Get the Official Trail Guide on Amazon\n                    </a>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            \n            <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify;\">\n                From Gatlinburg, Tennessee, the drive to Newfound Gap takes approximately 45 minutes via the scenic Newfound Gap Road (US 441). From Cherokee, North Carolina, expect about 30 minutes of winding mountain roads. The parking area includes restroom facilities, but no water sources, so plan accordingly. During my early morning visits, I've found that arriving by 7:30 AM almost guarantees a parking spot, even during peak fall foliage season.\n            </p>\n            \n            <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify;\">\n                The elevation at Newfound Gap means temperatures can be 10-15 degrees cooler than nearby towns, so dress in layers. I've experienced everything from brilliant sunshine to dense fog and even unexpected snow flurries at this elevation, regardless of the forecast for lower elevations. Weather conditions change rapidly in the mountains, making proper preparation essential for your <strong>charlies bunion</strong> adventure.\n            </p>\n        </section>\n\n        <section id=\"trail-details\" style=\"margin-bottom: 50px;\">\n            <h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2d5016; margin-bottom: 25px; border-bottom: 3px solid #4a7c59; padding-bottom: 10px;\">\n                <i class=\"fas fa-map\" style=\"color: #4a7c59; margin-right: 12px;\"></i>Detailed Trail Guide\n            </h2>\n            \n            <div style=\"text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n                <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BrQsUzn5koo\" title=\"Charlies Bunion Trail Guide Video\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\"></iframe>\n            </div>\n            \n            <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify;\">\n                The trail to <strong>charlies bunion</strong> follows the legendary Appalachian Trail eastbound from the Newfound Gap parking area. Look for the brown wooden sign marking the AT, located near the Rockefeller Memorial. The trail isn't specifically marked for charlies bunion, so follow signs for \"Appalachian Trail\" and \"Icewater Spring Shelter.\"\n            </p>\n            \n            <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2d5016; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">Mile 0-2: The Ascent Through Ancient Forest</h3>\n            <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify;\">\n                The first two miles present a steady uphill climb through pristine old-growth forest. You'll gain approximately 1,000 feet of elevation during this section, with the trail winding through magnificent stands of red spruce and Fraser fir. During spring, this area comes alive with wildflowers including trout lily, spring beauty, and various violet species. The well-maintained trail features excellent footing, though roots and rocks require attention.\n            </p>\n            \n            <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2d5016; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">Mile 2-3: Ridge Walking and Viewpoints</h3>\n            <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify;\">\n                Around mile 2, the trail reaches the main ridge and begins following the Tennessee-North Carolina border. This section offers your first spectacular viewpoints, with glimpses of Mount LeConte and Myrtle Point to the northwest. The narrow ridge walking here makes you feel like you're traversing the spine of the Appalachian Mountains, with dramatic drop-offs on both sides providing constant scenic rewards.\n            </p>\n            \n            <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2d5016; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">Mile 3-4: Final Approach to Charlies Bunion</h3>\n            <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify;\">\n                At approximately 3.8 miles, watch for the short spur trail branching left toward <strong>charlies bunion</strong>. This final 0.3-mile section descends slightly through rocky terrain before reaching the dramatic exposed outcrop. The spur trail is well-marked but requires careful footing over loose rocks and exposed roots.

The trail follows the Appalachian Trail for most of its length, featuring well-maintained but rugged paths. Weather conditions can change rapidly at this elevation, making proper preparation essential. Most hikers complete the journey in 4-6 hours, depending on fitness level and rest stops.

Summer provides the warmest weather but can be crowded and hazy, reducing visibility. Fall showcases spectacular foliage, making it my personal favorite season for this hike. Winter hiking is possible but requires ice gear and extreme caution due to icy conditions on exposed rocky sections. Early morning starts are recommended year-round to avoid crowds and catch the best lighting for photography.
