After countless trails and testing dozens of budget alternatives, I've learned that finding quality cheap hiking clothes is more about understanding fabric technology and knowing where to shop than spending hundreds of dollars on brand names. The key to successful budget hiking clothing lies in prioritizing function over fashion and understanding which features actually matter on the trail.</p>\n\n                <p>The most important principle when shopping for <strong>cheap hiking clothes</strong> is avoiding cotton at all costs. Cotton retains moisture, takes forever to dry, and can actually be dangerous in cold or wet conditions. Instead, focus on synthetic materials like polyester, nylon blends, or if your budget allows, merino wool. These materials wick moisture away from your skin, dry quickly, and maintain insulation properties even when damp. I've found excellent synthetic options at retailers like <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/hiking-clothes\" style=\"color: #4a7c59;\"><i>Target, Walmart, and Decathlon</i></a> that perform nearly as well as expensive alternatives.</p>\n\n                <p>Another crucial aspect of budget hiking clothing is understanding the layering system. Rather than buying one expensive jacket, you can create a versatile system with multiple cheaper layers. A lightweight synthetic base layer, a fleece or synthetic insulation mid-layer, and a simple rain shell can handle most conditions for under $100 total. This approach also gives you more flexibility to adjust your temperature as conditions change throughout the day. I've used this strategy on everything from summer day hikes to winter backpacking trips, and it's never let me down.</p>\n\n                <p>Quality budget hiking gear also means focusing your spending on the items that matter most. In my experience, socks and base layers see the most wear and have the biggest impact on comfort, so it's worth spending a bit more on these items. You can save money on outer layers like rain jackets or puffy coats that you might only use occasionally. Smart shopping also means taking advantage of end-of-season sales, outlet stores, and even thrift shops in outdoor-oriented areas where you can find name-brand gear at fraction of retail cost.</p>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Section 2 -->\n            <section id=\"best-places\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n                <h2 style=\"color: #2d5a87; font-size: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #4a7c59; padding-bottom: 10px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-map-marker-alt\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\"></i>Best Places to Find Cheap Hiking Clothes</h2>\n\n                <h3 style=\"color: #4a7c59; font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 25px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-store\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Discount Retailers and Outlet Stores</h3>\n                \n                <p>My number one recommendation for finding cheap hiking clothes is REI Outlet and their famous garage sales. I've scored incredible deals here, including a $200 Patagonia jacket for $45 and quality hiking pants for under $25. The REI garage sales happen periodically throughout the year, and members get early access to the best deals. Similarly, <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/hiking-clothes-sale\" style=\"color: #4a7c59;\"><b>Steep &amp; Cheap</b></a> offers name-brand outdoor gear at 30-70% off retail prices. I check their site daily during hiking season and have built most of my budget gear collection through their flash sales.</p>\n\n                <p>Decathlon deserves special mention as a game-changer for budget outdoor gear. Their in-house brands like Quechua, Forclaz, and Simond offer incredible value. I've tested their MH100 hiking shirts (around $10-15), and they perform as well as shirts costing three times more. Their hiking pants, base layers, and even technical gear like down jackets often cost 50-70% less than comparable name-brand items. The quality isn't always perfect, but for casual hikers, it's more than adequate.</p>\n\n                <p>Don't overlook big box stores like Costco, Target, and even Walmart for budget hiking clothing. Costco's Kirkland brand outdoor gear is manufactured by major outdoor companies and offers exceptional value. Target's All in Motion and Goodfellow &amp; Co. lines include excellent synthetic workout clothes that work perfectly for hiking. I've found moisture-wicking shirts for $8-12 and convertible pants for under $20 that have lasted multiple seasons. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wrangler-Outdoor-All-Terrain-Protection/dp/B07KQZX7VZ?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"color: #4a7c59; text-decoration: underline;\">Wrangler's ATG line at Walmart</a> offers excellent value for hiking pants at $25-35.</p>\n\n                <h3 style=\"color: #4a7c59; font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 25px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-calendar-alt\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Seasonal Sales and Timing Strategies</h3>\n\n                <p>Timing your purchases can save you 40-60% on hiking clothes. End-of-season clearances are goldmines for budget hikers. I buy winter gear in March-April and summer clothes in August-September when retailers need to move inventory. Black Friday and end-of-year sales also offer excellent opportunities. Sign up for email newsletters from Columbia, REI, Patagonia, and other outdoor brands to get early notification of sales. Many brands also offer student, military, and first responder discounts year-round.</p>\n                \n                <div style=\"background-color: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; margin: 20px 0;\">\n                    <p style=\"margin: 0; color: #856404;\"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Create a wishlist of specific items and monitor prices across multiple retailers.

For warmer weather, Target's All in Motion synthetic tees work excellently and often go on sale for under $10.

The Hanes X-Temp line available at Walmart offers excellent moisture management at $8-12 per shirt. For cooler conditions, <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/merino-wool-hiking-clothes\" style=\"color: #4a7c59;\"><i>lightweight fleece options</i></a> from Columbia or REI's house brand provide great warmth-to-weight ratio.

These synthetic blends dry quickly and offer good mobility for under $25. Eddie Bauer often has sales on their Guide Pro pants, which I've seen as low as $30 and represent exceptional quality for the price. Always look for features like articulated knees, reinforced wear areas, and secure pocket closures.</p>\n\n                <h3 style=\"color: #4a7c59; font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 25px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-socks\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Socks and Footwear Accessories</h3>\n\n                <p>Quality hiking socks are where I recommend investing a bit more of your budget, as poor socks can ruin any hike with blisters and discomfort.

They provide natural odor resistance, moisture management, and durability that justifies the higher price. When shopping for budget hiking socks, prioritize cushioning in heel and toe areas, moisture-wicking materials, and avoid cotton blends entirely.</p>\n\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;\">\n                    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=budget+hiking+clothes&amp;tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"background: linear-gradient(135deg, #4a7c59 0%, #2d5a87 100%); color: white; padding: 15px 30px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 25px; font-weight: bold; display: inline-block; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); transition: transform 0.2s;\"><i class=\"fas fa-shopping-cart\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Shop Budget Hiking Clothes on Amazon</a>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Section 4 -->\n            <section id=\"personal-experience\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n                <h2 style=\"color: #2d5a87; font-size: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #4a7c59; padding-bottom: 10px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-mountain\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\"></i>My Personal Experience Testing Budget Gear</h2>\n\n                <img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcS4GIQmiWjNBLQSfDA7AgEPAyi_14TBUfV0st98saYmR_UGcnaja3qOAfV4sqW7mCkPLILZDmML-khE3wkKqBIXOgvii4-AMTlSk58i86uwLZYVNCjWkDEO\" alt=\"Frogg Toggs ultra-lite rain suit showing affordable rain gear options for budget hikers\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: 300px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\">\n\n                <h3 style=\"color: #4a7c59; font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 25px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-hiking\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Real-World Testing on Popular Trails</h3>\n\n                <p>Over the past three years, I've deliberately tested cheap hiking clothes on challenging trails to see how they really perform. On my recent hike up Mount Washington in New Hampshire, I wore a complete budget outfit totaling under $75: Walmart's Ozark Trail convertible pants ($23), a Target synthetic long-sleeve shirt ($12), Dickies hiking socks ($4), and a Columbia fleece I got on clearance ($35). The conditions were perfect for testing - temperatures from 45°F at the base to 28°F at the summit, with high winds and occasional snow flurries.</p>\n\n                <p>The results surprised even me. The Ozark Trail pants handled the rocky scrambles without a single snag, the quick-dry fabric managed moisture from both sweat and snow perfectly, and the convertible legs allowed easy temperature regulation. The Target shirt wicked moisture effectively during the steep climb and dried quickly when I stopped for breaks. Most importantly, this budget combination kept me comfortable and safe in conditions that would challenge much more expensive gear.</p>\n\n                <p>During my summer backpacking trip on the <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/summer-hiking-clothes\" style=\"color: #4a7c59;\"><i>Appalachian Trail in Virginia</i></a>, I tested various budget base layers and shirts over four days of hiking in 80-90°F temperatures with high humidity. The clear winner was Amazon Essentials quick-dry shirts at $16 each - they managed sweat better than my $45 Patagonia shirt and showed no signs of odor even after multiple days of wear. This experience taught me that expensive doesn't always mean better, especially for basic moisture management.</p>\n\n                <h3 style=\"color: #4a7c59; font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 25px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-snowflake\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Winter Hiking on a Budget</h3>\n\n                <p>Winter hiking presents unique challenges for budget-conscious hikers, but it's absolutely doable with smart shopping. Last winter, I completed several snowshoe hikes in Vermont using almost entirely budget gear. My layering system consisted of Costco's Kirkland merino base layer ($25), a Walmart fleece hoodie ($18), and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Frogg-Toggs-Mens-Ultra-Lite/dp/B007QBYCLA?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"color: #4a7c59; text-decoration: underline;\">Frogg Toggs rain suit for wind/snow protection</a> ($20). This $63 system kept me comfortable in temperatures down to 15°F with proper activity level management.</p>\n\n                <p>The key lesson from winter testing is that layering trumps expensive single pieces. Multiple thin layers allow better temperature control and cost less than one expensive winter jacket. I learned to manage my activity level and layer addition/removal to stay comfortable. The budget approach also meant I wasn't afraid to get gear dirty or damaged, which actually made me more confident and adventurous on the trail.</p>\n\n                <div style=\"background-color: #d1ecf1; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border-left: 4px solid #17a2b8; margin: 20px 0;\">\n                    <p style=\"margin: 0; color: #0c5460;\"><strong>Key Learning:</strong> Budget gear requires more active management and awareness of your body temperature, but this actually made me a better hiker who understands layering and thermal regulation principles.</p>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Section 5 -->\n            <section id=\"seasonal-strategies\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n                <h2 style=\"color: #2d5a87; font-size: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #4a7c59; padding-bottom: 10px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-calendar\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\"></i>Seasonal Budget Hiking Clothing Strategies</h2>\n\n                <h3 style=\"color: #4a7c59; font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 25px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-sun\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Spring and Summer Budget Solutions</h3>\n\n                <p>Spring and summer offer the easiest opportunities for budget hiking clothing success. During these seasons, you can often get away with regular athletic wear from discount retailers. I've had excellent results with Target's All in Motion shorts ($15-20) and Old Navy's moisture-wicking tees ($8-12). The key is looking for synthetic blends that dry quickly and offer basic UV protection. For <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/cool-hiking-clothes\" style=\"color: #4a7c59;\"><b>hot weather hiking</b></a>, lighter colors and loose fits work better than expensive technical fabrics.</p>\n\n                <p>One area where I recommend spending slightly more in summer is on a good sun hat and lightweight long-sleeve shirt for sun protection. However, you can find excellent options at discount prices. Walmart's outdoor section often carries UPF-rated shirts for $12-18, and their wide-brim hats provide excellent protection for under $15. Remember that preventing sun damage is much cheaper than treating it later.</p>\n\n                <p>For summer rain protection, don't overthink it. A simple poncho or lightweight rain jacket from Target or Walmart will handle most summer showers perfectly. I've used a $12 Ozark Trail rain jacket for three seasons without issues. Summer rain is usually warm, so expensive breathable rain gear is often overkill unless you're doing serious mountain hiking where weather can change rapidly.</p>\n\n                <h3 style=\"color: #4a7c59; font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 25px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-leaf\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Fall and Winter Budget Strategies</h3>\n\n                <p>Fall and winter require more strategic thinking for budget hikers, but it's entirely possible to stay warm and dry without expensive gear. The key is mastering the layering system with multiple inexpensive pieces. I typically use a synthetic base layer ($15-25), fleece mid-layer ($20-35), and windproof outer shell ($25-40). This system costs $60-100 total but provides more versatility than a single expensive jacket costing $200+.</p>\n\n                <p>For <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/winter-hiking-clothes\" style=\"color: #4a7c59;\"><i>winter hiking clothes</i></a>, thrift stores in mountain areas can be goldmines. I've found high-quality fleeces, base layers, and even some technical gear at fraction of retail cost. Military surplus stores also offer excellent cold-weather gear at budget prices. Wool military sweaters and base layers often outperform expensive civilian alternatives and cost much less.</p>\n\n                <p>Don't forget about accessories in cold weather budgeting. Quality gloves, hat, and neck protection are essential but don't need to be expensive. I've used $5 knit gloves with $3 liner gloves very successfully. A simple fleece buff or neck warmer from discount retailers works as well as expensive alternatives. Focus on wind protection and layering rather than expensive single pieces.</p>\n\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;\">\n                    <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CaCWWbMfo6s\" title=\"The Best Hiking and Backpacking Gear For Under $50!\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\"></iframe>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Section 6 -->\n            <section id=\"user-reviews\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n                <h2 style=\"color: #2d5a87; font-size: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #4a7c59; padding-bottom: 10px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-users\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\"></i>User Reviews and Real-World Performance</h2>\n\n                <h3 style=\"color: #4a7c59; font-size: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 25px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-star\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Amazon Customer Reviews Analysis</h3>\n\n                <p>After analyzing hundreds of Amazon reviews for budget hiking clothes, several clear patterns emerge.

However, many budget hikers report excellent experiences. A reviewer noted: \"I was skeptical about $23 hiking pants, but after 6 months of weekend hiking, they show minimal wear and have kept me comfortable in all conditions.\" The key seems to be inspecting items carefully before purchase and understanding that while quality may vary, the value proposition often makes it worthwhile.</p>\n\n                <p>Costco's outdoor clothing receives consistently positive reviews from both casual and serious hikers.

These four items form the foundation of any budget hiking wardrobe and can be found at retailers like REI, Decathlon, Target, or even Walmart. Focus on synthetic materials or merino wool blends that dry quickly and avoid cotton at all costs, as it retains moisture and can lead to hypothermia in cold conditions. Start with these basics and add specialized pieces like rain gear or insulation layers as your hiking experience grows.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div style=\"background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n                    <h3 style=\"color: #2d5a87; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Where can I find the best deals on hiking clothing?</h3>\n                    <p style=\"margin: 0; color: #555;\">The best deals on hiking clothing can be found at several key sources: REI Outlet and garage sales offer 30-70% off name brands, Decathlon provides excellent value with their in-house outdoor brands, end-of-season clearances at major retailers like Columbia and REI, online discount retailers like Steep &amp; Cheap, thrift stores in outdoor-oriented areas, and even big box stores like Costco and Target. Sign up for email alerts from your favorite brands to catch flash sales, and shop end-of-season clearances when retailers need to move inventory. Don't overlook military surplus stores for cold-weather gear and remember that timing your purchases around major sale periods can save you 40-60% on quality hiking clothes.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div style=\"background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n                    <h3 style=\"color: #2d5a87; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;\">How much should I budget for a complete set of hiking clothes?</h3>\n                    <p style=\"margin: 0; color: #555;\">A complete set of quality cheap hiking clothes can range from $100-200 depending on your approach. Budget breakdown: hiking pants or shorts ($25-40), moisture-wicking shirts ($15-25 each, get 2-3), quality hiking socks ($10-20 per pair, get 3 pairs), base layers for cooler weather ($20-35), lightweight fleece or hoodie ($25-50), and basic rain jacket ($30-60). You can cut costs significantly by shopping sales, buying from discount retailers, or starting with what you already own and upgrading pieces over time as you hike more frequently. Remember that this investment will last multiple seasons with proper care, making the cost per use very reasonable for regular hikers.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div style=\"background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n                    <h3 style=\"color: #2d5a87; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Can I use regular athletic wear for hiking instead of specialized gear?</h3>\n                    <p style=\"margin: 0; color: #555;\">Regular athletic wear can work well for hiking, especially synthetic workout clothes from places like Target, Old Navy, or even Walmart. The key is avoiding cotton and choosing moisture-wicking synthetic materials or merino wool. Running shorts, yoga pants, athletic t-shirts, and gym hoodies often perform similarly to expensive hiking-specific gear. However, specialized hiking clothes offer advantages like reinforced knees, better pocket placement, UV protection, and more durable construction. Start with quality athletic wear you already own, then upgrade to hiking-specific pieces as your needs become clearer through experience on the trail. This approach allows you to get started hiking immediately without a large gear investment.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div style=\"background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n                    <h3 style=\"color: #2d5a87; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;\">What's the difference between cheap and expensive hiking clothes?</h3>\n                    <p style=\"margin: 0; color: #555;\">The main differences between cheap and expensive hiking clothes are durability, advanced features, and brand reputation. Expensive gear often lasts longer, has better zippers and hardware, more thoughtful design details, and advanced fabric technologies like superior moisture-wicking or odor resistance. However, many budget options use similar base fabrics and perform nearly as well for casual hikers. Cheap hiking clothes might need replacement sooner but can be perfectly adequate for weekend warriors. Focus your budget on items that see the most wear (socks, base layers) and save money on items used less frequently (rain gear, insulation layers). The performance gap has narrowed significantly in recent years as budget retailers have improved their technical offerings.</p>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Conclusion -->\n            <section id=\"conclusion\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n                <h2 style=\"color: #2d5a87; font-size: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #4a7c59; padding-bottom: 10px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-flag-checkered\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\"></i>Conclusion</h2>\n\n                <p>Finding quality cheap hiking clothes is absolutely possible with the right knowledge and shopping strategies. After years of testing budget gear on demanding trails, I can confidently say that you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars to stay comfortable, safe, and dry while hiking. The key principles are simple: avoid cotton, prioritize function over brand names, master the layering system, and shop strategically during sales and at discount retailers.</p>\n\n                <p>The hiking gear industry wants you to believe that expensive equals better, but my real-world testing proves otherwise. A $23 pair of Ozark Trail pants has kept me comfortable on challenging mountain hikes, $15 Target synthetic shirts manage moisture as well as $60 alternatives, and Costco's $3 merino socks rival premium options costing seven times more. The secret isn't finding the cheapest gear possible, but understanding which features actually matter and where to find quality at budget prices.</p>\n\n                <p>Remember that <strong>cheap hiking clothes</strong> are a means to an end - getting you outdoors to enjoy nature's beauty. Don't let gear costs prevent you from exploring amazing trails and creating lasting memories. Start with budget basics, learn what works for your hiking style, and upgrade strategically over time. Some of my most memorable hikes have been accomplished wearing entirely budget gear that I wasn't afraid to get dirty or damaged.</p>\n\n                <p>Whether you're shopping at <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/lightweight-hiking-clothes\" style=\"color: #4a7c59;\"><i>Decathlon for lightweight options</i></a>, hunting deals at REI outlets, or discovering gems at Target and Walmart, quality cheap hiking clothes are within reach. Focus your budget on the pieces that matter most (socks and base layers), shop the sales cycles, and don't be afraid to try budget alternatives to expensive gear. Your wallet will thank you, and you'll discover that adventure doesn't require a premium price tag.</p>\n\n                <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;\">\n                    <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/\" style=\"background: linear-gradient(135deg, #4a7c59 0%, #2d5a87 100%); color: white; padding: 15px 30px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 25px; font-weight: bold; display: inline-block; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); transition: transform 0.2s;\"><i class=\"fas fa-home\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;\"></i>Explore More Budget Hiking Guides</a>\n                </div>\n\n                <div style=\"background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f8f9fa 0%, #e9ecef 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 30px; text-align: center;\">\n                    <h3 style=\"color: #2d5a87; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Related Budget Hiking Resources</h3>\n                    <div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)); gap: 15px;\">\n                        <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-hiking-clothes-for-women\" style=\"color: #4a7c59; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;\">Best Budget Women's Hiking Clothes</a>\n                        <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/mens-camping-clothes\" style=\"color: #4a7c59; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;\">Men's Budget Camping Gear</a>\n                        <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/survival-clothes\" style=\"color: #4a7c59; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;\">Budget Survival Clothing</a>\n                        <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/hiking-clothes-near-me\" style=\"color: #4a7c59; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;\">Local Hiking Stores Guide</a>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n        </main>\n\n        <!-- Footer -->\n        <footer style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; padding: 20px; background-color: #2d5a87; color: white; border-radius: 8px;\">\n            <p style=\"margin: 0; font-size: 0.9em;\">© 2025 Explore National Parks Store.
