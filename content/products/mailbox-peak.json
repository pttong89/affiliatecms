This 4,841-foot summit in Washington's Cascade Range serves as a rite of passage for serious hikers and mountaineers preparing for major alpine ascents. The peak's name comes from the actual mailbox installed at the summit, which serves as the trail register and has become an iconic symbol of accomplishment.</p>\n                \n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">What makes <i>Mailbox Peak</i> so challenging isn't just the elevation gain - it's the relentless nature of the climb. Whether you choose the infamous old trail or the newer switchback route, you'll face 4,000+ feet of vertical ascent that tests your physical limits and mental determination. The mountain has become legendary among Seattle-area hikers, with stories of rescues, exhausted climbers, and triumphant summits passed down through the hiking community.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">The trail system offers two distinct experiences: the original \"old trail\" that climbs directly up the ridge with minimal switchbacks, and the \"new trail\" completed in 2014 that provides a more sustainable but longer route to the summit. Both converge for the final rocky scramble to the mailbox, where panoramic views of Mount Rainier, the Middle Fork Valley, and the Cascade Range reward those who complete the journey.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg\">Understanding the history and character of this peak is crucial for a successful summit attempt. Similar to other challenging Washington hikes like <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/piestewa-peak\" class=\"text-blue-600 font-semibold\">Piestewa Peak</a> and <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/cucamonga-peak\" class=\"text-blue-600 font-semibold\">Cucamonga Peak</a>, preparation and respect for the mountain are essential for a safe and rewarding experience.</p>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Trail Comparison Section -->\n            <section id=\"trail-comparison\" class=\"mb-12\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6\">Old Trail vs New Trail: Which Should You Choose?</h2>\n                <div class=\"mb-6\">\n                    <img src=\"https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/mailbox-main.jpg/@@images/2911a728-a020-41cc-98fa-61a6414f380f.jpeg\" alt=\"Mailbox Peak old trail showing the steep rocky terrain and forest approach\" class=\"w-full h-64 object-cover rounded-lg shadow-md\">\n                </div>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">The choice between <b>Mailbox Peak's</b> two trails is one of the most important decisions you'll make for your summit attempt. Each offers dramatically different experiences, challenges, and rewards. The old trail represents the mountain's original character - a brutal, uncompromising ascent that has humbled countless hikers. The new trail provides a more civilized approach while still delivering the full elevation challenge.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">The Legendary Old Trail: 2.6 Miles of Pure Punishment</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">The old trail is <i>Mailbox Peak</i> at its most raw and demanding. Gaining 4,000 feet in just 2.6 miles, this route maintains an average grade of over 30% with sections approaching 45% incline. There are virtually no switchbacks - the trail follows the fall line straight up the ridge, making every step a battle against gravity. This is the trail that built the mountain's fearsome reputation and continues to serve as a conditioning route for serious mountaineers.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">The old trail begins innocuously enough, following a gentle creek for the first quarter-mile before revealing its true nature. What follows is an unrelenting climb through dense forest on loose, rocky terrain interspersed with treacherous root systems that become slick death traps when wet. The trail is marked by white reflectors nailed to trees, crucial for navigation in the frequent Pacific Northwest fog.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">The New Trail: Sustainable Challenge with Strategic Switchbacks</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Completed in 2014 by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources with help from Washington Trails Association volunteers, the new trail spreads the same elevation gain over 5.5 miles. This route incorporates proper trail engineering with sustainable grades, well-constructed switchbacks, and bridges over creek crossings. While longer, it provides a more accessible way to experience the <b>Mailbox Peak</b> challenge.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg\">The strategic choice many experienced hikers make is combining both trails: ascending via the new trail when legs are fresh and energy is high, then descending the shorter but treacherous old trail. This approach maximizes safety while minimizing total hiking time. For those seeking the ultimate test, similar to challenges found on <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/guadalupe-peak-trail\" class=\"text-blue-600 font-semibold\">Guadalupe Peak Trail</a>, the old trail up and down remains the gold standard for conditioning hikes in the Pacific Northwest.</p>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Essential Gear Section -->\n            <section id=\"essential-gear\" class=\"mb-12\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6\">Essential Gear and Equipment for Mailbox Peak</h2>\n                <div class=\"mb-6\">\n                    <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d09463a7ff6500001c3c9ba/1624768445542-6R8LTLODNB4KHDYW0TRZ/Mailbox-3.jpg\" alt=\"Hiker with trekking poles navigating the rocky boulder field near Mailbox Peak summit\" class=\"w-full h-64 object-cover rounded-lg shadow-md\">\n                </div>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Proper gear selection can mean the difference between a successful summit and a dangerous rescue situation on <b>Mailbox Peak</b>. The mountain's reputation for injuries and emergencies stems largely from unprepared hikers who underestimate both the physical demands and technical challenges of the final rocky scramble to the summit.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">Footwear: Your Foundation for Success</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Quality waterproof hiking boots are absolutely non-negotiable for <i>Mailbox Peak</i>. The trail features slippery roots, loose rocks, creek crossings, and a final boulder scramble that demands superior traction and ankle support. I recommend the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLWBG2C1?tag=natureguests00-20\" class=\"text-blue-600 font-semibold\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Men's Newton Ridge Plus II Waterproof Hiking Boot</a>, which provides excellent grip on Washington's notoriously slick terrain while maintaining waterproof protection for the multiple creek crossings.</p>\n\n                <div class=\"bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4\">\n                    <p class=\"text-center\">\n                        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLWBG2C1?tag=natureguests00-20\" class=\"inline-block bg-green-600 text-white font-bold py-3 px-6 rounded-lg hover:bg-green-700 transition duration-300 no-underline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-hiking mr-2\"></i>Get Premium Hiking Boots on Amazon\n                        </a>\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">Trekking Poles: Essential for Knee Preservation</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Trekking poles aren't optional equipment for this hike - they're mandatory safety gear. The descent, particularly on the old trail, puts tremendous stress on knees and significantly increases fall risk without proper support. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L2HYPNW?tag=natureguests00-20\" class=\"text-blue-600 font-semibold\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cascade Mountain Tech Lightweight Aircraft-Grade Aluminum Trekking Poles</a> offer the durability and adjustability needed for <b>Mailbox Peak's</b> varied terrain.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">Hydration Systems: Preventing the Most Common Rescue Scenario</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Dehydration accounts for the majority of rescue calls from <i>Mailbox Peak</i>. Plan for minimum 3 liters of water per person, more in summer conditions. A quality hydration backpack like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TR9LPKN?tag=natureguests00-20\" class=\"text-blue-600 font-semibold\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightweight Hydration Backpack with 2L Water Bladder</a> allows hands-free hydration during the demanding climb.</p>\n\n                <div class=\"bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4\">\n                    <p class=\"text-center\">\n                        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TR9LPKN?tag=natureguests00-20\" class=\"inline-block bg-blue-600 text-white font-bold py-3 px-6 rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700 transition duration-300 no-underline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-tint mr-2\"></i>Shop Hydration Packs on Amazon\n                        </a>\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg\">Additional critical items include high-energy snacks, first aid supplies, headlamp (essential for early starts or late finishes), weather protection layers, and emergency communication device. The same level of preparation required for peaks like <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/hiking-pikes-peak\" class=\"text-blue-600 font-semibold\">Pikes Peak</a> applies here, despite the shorter distance involved.</p>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Trail Guide Section -->\n            <section id=\"trail-guide\" class=\"mb-12\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6\">Step-by-Step Trail Guide and What to Expect</h2>\n                <div class=\"mb-6\">\n                    <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1AsRqKq2UU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"rounded-lg shadow-md\"></iframe>\n                </div>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Understanding the specific challenges and landmarks of <b>Mailbox Peak</b> is crucial for a successful ascent. This detailed breakdown covers both trail options, key decision points, and what to expect at each stage of your journey to the summit mailbox.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">Trailhead and Initial Approach (Elevation: 900 feet)</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Access requires a Discover Pass for parking at the upper trailhead. Arrive early - by 7 AM on weekends - as the lot fills quickly and overflow parking along Middle Fork Road creates safety hazards. The trail begins with a short walk up a gated gravel road, where you'll encounter the first major decision point: left for the new trail, straight for the old trail.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Both routes start deceptively easy, following the same drainage initially before diverging. This is your last chance for level terrain - use it for final gear checks and hydration. The <i>Mailbox Peak</i> experience officially begins when you commit to your chosen route, and there's no going back once the serious climbing starts.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">The Crucible: Mid-Mountain Challenges (2,500-3,500 feet)</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">This elevation band represents the heart of the <b>Mailbox Peak</b> challenge. On the old trail, you'll encounter the infamous \"root ladder\" sections where exposed roots create natural but treacherous steps. These become extremely hazardous when wet, contributing to the trail's accident statistics. The new trail offers more predictable footing but still requires constant attention as switchbacks wind through dense forest.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Mental preparation becomes as important as physical conditioning in this section. The relentless nature of the climb, combined with limited views through the forest canopy, tests psychological resilience. Many hikers turn back in this zone, making it the unofficial \"point of no return\" for summit attempts.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">Summit Approach and the Final Scramble (3,500-4,841 feet)</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">The old and new trails converge at approximately 3,800 feet for the final assault on the summit. This boulder field scramble requires different skills than the approach hike, demanding rock-hopping abilities and route-finding judgment. The exposure increases dramatically, with significant fall potential for careless moves.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg\">The summit mailbox serves as both destination and trail register. The 360-degree views reward your effort with spectacular vistas of Mount Rainier, the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, and the Snoqualmie River valley. Plan sufficient time here for rest, photos, and preparation for the challenging descent. Similar to the satisfaction felt on other demanding peaks like <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/sandstone-peak\" class=\"text-blue-600 font-semibold\">Sandstone Peak</a>, the <b>Mailbox Peak</b> summit represents a significant personal achievement.</p>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Safety Tips Section -->\n            <section id=\"safety-tips\" class=\"mb-12\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6\">Safety Tips and Rescue Prevention</h2>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\"><b>Mailbox Peak</b> generates more search and rescue calls than virtually any other day hike in Washington State. In 2025 alone, King County Search and Rescue responded to five emergency calls in a single week. Understanding the common failure points and implementing proper safety protocols can prevent you from becoming another statistic.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">The Big Three: Dehydration, Exhaustion, and Falls</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">These three factors account for over 80% of rescue situations on <i>Mailbox Peak</i>. Dehydration occurs rapidly due to the sustained physical effort combined with Washington's often humid conditions. Carry and consume water consistently - waiting until you feel thirsty means you're already behind. Electrolyte replacement becomes critical on longer attempts, especially during summer months.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Exhaustion manifests differently than simple tiredness. True exhaustion impairs judgment, increases fall risk, and can lead to life-threatening hypothermia even in moderate weather. Know your limits and don't let summit fever override safety decisions. The mountain will be there for future attempts, but injured hikers may not get second chances.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">Weather Awareness and Seasonal Considerations</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Pacific Northwest weather changes rapidly, and <b>Mailbox Peak's</b> elevation makes it particularly susceptible to sudden storms. Summer morning starts often encounter afternoon thunderstorms, while spring and fall conditions can include snow above 3,000 feet. Always check current conditions and carry appropriate layers regardless of the forecast.</p>\n\n                <div class=\"bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4\">\n                    <h4 class=\"text-lg font-semibold text-red-800 mb-2\"><i class=\"fas fa-exclamation-triangle mr-2\"></i>Emergency Protocol</h4>\n                    <ul class=\"list-disc pl-6 text-red-700\">\n                        <li>Cell service is sporadic - don't rely on it for rescue communication</li>\n                        <li>Carry emergency whistle and signaling device</li>\n                        <li>Know your exact location for rescue coordination</li>\n                        <li>Never attempt rescue beyond your skill level - call for help</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </div>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">Descent Safety: When Most Accidents Occur</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">The majority of injuries happen during descent when fatigue combines with steeper terrain and loose footing. Take your time, use trekking poles religiously, and consider the longer new trail descent even if you ascended via the old trail. Your knees and ankles will thank you, and you'll significantly reduce injury risk.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg\">Gate closure at 8 PM creates additional urgency that can lead to poor decisions. Plan conservatively and be prepared to park outside the gate if you're running behind schedule. The same safety principles that apply to technical peaks like <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/twin-sisters-peak\" class=\"text-blue-600 font-semibold\">Twin Sisters Peak</a> are equally important on <i>Mailbox Peak</i> despite its proximity to urban areas.</p>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Personal Experience Section -->\n            <section id=\"personal-experience\" class=\"mb-12\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6\">My Personal Experience and Local Insights</h2>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Having completed <b>Mailbox Peak</b> over a dozen times via both routes and across all seasons, I can attest that no two ascents are identical. My first attempt in 2018 taught me harsh lessons about preparation and respect for this mountain, while recent climbs have reinforced why it remains the Pacific Northwest's premier conditioning hike.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">Lessons Learned Through Trial and Muddy Boots</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">My inaugural <i>Mailbox Peak</i> attempt followed the old trail on a rainy October morning - a recipe for near-disaster. Wearing running shoes and carrying a single water bottle, I underestimated both the physical demands and technical challenges. The famous root sections became ice rinks in the rain, and I spent more time on my backside than on my feet. That humbling experience taught me the importance of proper footwear and weather assessment.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Subsequent attempts with quality hiking boots like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VX6Y3S?tag=natureguests00-20\" class=\"text-blue-600 font-semibold\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Men's White Ledge Mid Waterproof Hiking Boot</a> transformed the experience. The difference in confidence and safety with proper gear cannot be overstated. I learned that gear isn't about comfort - it's about capability and survival on this unforgiving peak.</p>\n\n                <div class=\"bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4\">\n                    <p class=\"text-center\">\n                        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N46UYTL?tag=natureguests00-20\" class=\"inline-block bg-yellow-600 text-white font-bold py-3 px-6 rounded-lg hover:bg-yellow-700 transition duration-300 no-underline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-mountain mr-2\"></i>Get Professional Trekking Poles\n                        </a>\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">Seasonal Insights from Multiple Ascents</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Winter ascents of <b>Mailbox Peak</b> reveal the mountain's most dangerous character. Snow above 2,500 feet combined with the old trail's steep grade creates serious avalanche potential. I've witnessed slides in the final approach couloir during high avalanche danger periods. Microspikes become mandatory equipment, and route knowledge becomes critical for safe navigation.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Summer provides the most predictable conditions but brings different challenges. Early morning starts at 5:30 AM have become my standard approach to avoid both crowds and afternoon heat. The parking lot fills by 8 AM on weekends, and late arrivals face dangerous roadside parking situations along Middle Fork Road.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">User Reviews and Community Feedback</h3>\n                <div class=\"bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4\">\n                    <p class=\"italic mb-2\">\"This trail humbled me completely.

This mirrors my experience with other challenging hikes like <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/high-peak-trail\" class=\"text-blue-600 font-semibold\">High Peak Trail</a>, where mountain respect is the foundation of safe hiking.</p>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Conclusion Section -->\n            <section id=\"conclusion\" class=\"mb-12\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6\">Conclusion</h2>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\"><b>Mailbox Peak</b> represents far more than a simple day hike - it's a proving ground that tests physical conditioning, mental determination, and mountaineering judgment in equal measure. Whether you choose the brutal directness of the old trail or the strategic approach of the new trail, this 4,841-foot summit will challenge everything you think you know about hiking difficulty.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Success on this mountain requires honest self-assessment, proper gear investment, and absolute respect for the conditions and terrain. The rescue statistics aren't exaggerations or coincidences - they represent real consequences for inadequate preparation. But for those who approach <i>Mailbox Peak</i> with appropriate seriousness and preparation, the rewards extend far beyond the summit views.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">This hike builds the physical base and mental resilience needed for bigger objectives throughout the Cascades and beyond. The lessons learned struggling up those relentless switchbacks or navigating the treacherous old trail translate directly to success on more technical peaks. Consider <b>Mailbox Peak</b> your gateway drug to serious mountaineering - it will either inspire you to pursue bigger challenges or teach you to appreciate easier trails.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-4\">Remember that completion isn't mandatory - safe return is. The mountain has humbled experienced climbers and rewarded prepared beginners. Your summit attempt should prioritize safety over ego, preparation over bravado. The mailbox will be there for future attempts, but injured hikers don't always get second chances.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg\">Plan your <i>Mailbox Peak</i> adventure with the same care you'd give to major expeditions. Invest in quality gear, train appropriately, and choose conditions wisely. Whether this becomes your regular conditioning hike or a once-in-a-lifetime challenge, approach it with the respect it demands and the preparation it requires. The summit views of Mount Rainier and the satisfaction of conquering Washington's most notorious day hike await those who earn them through sweat, determination, and proper planning.

The old trail gains 4,000 feet in just 2.6 miles with relentless steep sections, while the new trail spreads the same elevation gain over 5.5 miles with switchbacks. Both routes require excellent physical conditioning and proper preparation. The final boulder scramble adds technical challenges beyond simple hiking. Most first-time visitors underestimate the difficulty, leading to the high rescue call statistics. Physical fitness equivalent to running a half-marathon plus rock scrambling skills are recommended minimums.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">Should I take the old trail or new trail?</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-6\">Choose based on your fitness level and preference. The old trail is shorter but brutally steep - ideal for conditioning training but dangerous for inexperienced hikers. It gains 4,000 feet in 2.6 miles with virtually no switchbacks, following the fall line directly up the ridge. The new trail is longer but more sustainable with proper switchbacks, making it safer for most hikers. Many experienced hikers go up the new trail and down the old trail to maximize safety while minimizing total time. First-time visitors should strongly consider the new trail unless they're exceptionally fit and experienced with steep terrain.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">What gear do I need for Mailbox Peak?</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-6\">Essential gear includes waterproof hiking boots with aggressive tread, trekking poles, hydration system (3+ liters minimum), high-energy snacks, first aid kit, headlamp, and weather protection layers. The final approach involves boulder scrambling, so boots with excellent grip are crucial. Microspikes recommended in winter conditions. Emergency whistle and signaling device are important due to spotty cell coverage. Quality rain gear is essential year-round due to Pacific Northwest weather patterns. Don't underestimate gear requirements - proper equipment prevents the majority of rescue situations on this peak.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">When is the best time to hike Mailbox Peak?</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-6\">May through October offers the best conditions, with July-September being optimal for clear summit views of Mount Rainier and surrounding peaks. Start early (6-7 AM) to avoid crowds and afternoon heat, as parking lots fill by 8 AM on weekends. Winter hiking is possible but requires avalanche awareness, proper gear, and experience with snow conditions. Avoid during heavy rain due to extremely slippery root sections that become dangerous. Shoulder seasons (April, November) can provide excellent conditions with fewer crowds but require weather monitoring and appropriate gear for changing conditions.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3\">How long does it take to hike Mailbox Peak?</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-lg mb-6\">Plan 5-8 hours total depending on trail choice, fitness level, and conditions. The old trail typically takes 2.5-4 hours up and 2-3 hours down for experienced hikers, while the new trail requires 3-5 hours up and 2.5-3.5 hours down. Add extra time for rest stops, summit enjoyment, weather delays, and the technical boulder scramble. First-time visitors often take significantly longer than expected due to the sustained difficulty. Gate closure at 8 PM creates time pressure, so conservative planning is essential. Many hikers underestimate descent time, particularly on the old trail where fatigue combines with technical terrain.</p>\n            </section>\n        </main>\n\n        <!-- Footer -->\n        <footer class=\"bg-gray-800 text-white p-6 text-center\">\n            <p class=\"mb-2\">© 2025 Explore National Parks Store.
