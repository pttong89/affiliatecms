Heavier runners may need to replace shoes closer to 300 miles, while lighter runners might get 500+ miles.

Unlike sponsored reviews or marketing materials, Reddit discussions offer brutally honest feedback from users who've logged hundreds of miles in their shoes.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"mb-6\">The most consistent theme across Reddit discussions is the importance of individual fit over brand loyalty. As one highly upvoted comment in r/beginnerrunning stated, \"The best running shoe is the one that fits your foot and feels comfortable immediately - not the one that gets the most hype.\" This sentiment appeared repeatedly across multiple threads, with experienced runners emphasizing that <b><i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-running-shoes-reddit\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\">foot shape and gait</a></i></b> matter more than brand reputation.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"mb-6\">Reddit users consistently debunk the overpronation myth that's prevalent in retail settings. Multiple physical therapists and podiatrists who participate in these communities explain that true overpronation affects a very small percentage of runners, yet stability shoes are often oversold. The consensus is to start with neutral shoes unless you have a diagnosed medical condition requiring additional support.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"mb-6\">Another key insight from Reddit discussions is the value of professional fitting at specialty running stores. However, users caution against high-pressure sales tactics and recommend visiting stores that allow you to run on treadmills or even outside. The most helpful advice comes from users who emphasize comfort over technical specifications, with many sharing stories of expensive, highly-rated shoes that didn't work for their individual needs.</p>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Section 2 -->\n            <section id=\"top-rated-shoes\" class=\"mb-12\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800\">Top-Rated Women's Running Shoes According to Reddit</h2>\n                \n                <div class=\"mb-6\">\n                    <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N5Ufl4l4Mc0\" title=\"Best Running Shoes for Women - Expert Review\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"rounded-lg shadow-md\"></iframe>\n                </div>\n\n                <p class=\"mb-6\">Based on extensive analysis of Reddit discussions, certain shoes appear consistently in positive recommendations across multiple communities. Here are the most frequently praised women's running shoes, along with real user feedback and current availability.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Brooks Ghost Series - Reddit's Comfort Champion</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">The Brooks Ghost consistently tops Reddit recommendation lists, with users praising its reliability and comfort. One r/XXRunning user with over 1,000 upvotes shared: \"I'm on my 4th pair of Brooks Ghost 15s. They're like the Toyota Camry of running shoes - not flashy, but incredibly dependable.\" Users appreciate the Ghost's balanced cushioning that works for both new and experienced runners.</p>\n                \n                <div class=\"bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4\">\n                    <p class=\"text-center\">\n                        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVXKQX8Z?tag=natureguests00-20\" class=\"inline-block bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white font-bold py-3 px-8 rounded-lg transition duration-300\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-shopping-cart mr-2\"></i>Check Brooks Ghost 16 Price on Amazon\n                        </a>\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">ASICS Novablast - The Bouncy Favorite</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">Reddit users rave about the ASICS Novablast's responsiveness and energy return. Multiple r/RunningShoeGeeks discussions highlight how this shoe provides \"trampoline-like\" bounce while maintaining stability. Users note it's particularly great for tempo runs and longer distances, though some mention durability concerns after 400+ miles.</p>\n\n                <div class=\"bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4\">\n                    <p class=\"text-center\">\n                        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8YN4H9Q?tag=natureguests00-20\" class=\"inline-block bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-3 px-8 rounded-lg transition duration-300\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-alt mr-2\"></i>View ASICS Novablast 5 on Amazon\n                        </a>\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Nike Pegasus - The Versatile Workhorse</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">The Nike Pegasus appears frequently in Reddit discussions as an excellent value option. Users appreciate its durability and versatility, with many reporting 500+ miles before replacement. The consensus is that while not the most exciting shoe, it's reliable for daily training and available at good prices, especially during Nike sales.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"mb-6\">Reddit users also frequently mention <b><i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-nike-running-shoes-reddit\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\">Nike's consistency across model years</a></i></b>, making it easier to stock up on previous versions when they go on sale. This strategy is particularly popular among budget-conscious runners who've found their perfect fit.</p>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Section 3 -->\n            <section id=\"brand-comparison\" class=\"mb-12\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800\">Brooks vs ASICS vs Nike: Reddit's Brand Comparison</h2>\n                <img src=\"https://www.runningshoesguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/comparison_28670_46525_48878__clipping_ma-633x356.jpg\" alt=\"Nike Pegasus vs Brooks Ghost comparison for women runners\" class=\"w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-6 rounded-lg shadow-md\" style=\"height: auto;\">\n                \n                <p class=\"mb-6\">Reddit users have strong opinions about different brands, often based on extensive personal experience. Here's what the community consistently says about the top three brands mentioned in women's running shoe discussions.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Brooks: The Reliability Champion</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">Reddit users consistently praise Brooks for durability and comfort, with many reporting 600+ mile lifespans. The brand appears most frequently in discussions about <b><i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-running-shoes-for-women-reddit\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\">reliable daily trainers</a></i></b>. Users appreciate Brooks' consistent fit across model years, making it easier to reorder the same shoe. However, some Reddit users find Brooks shoes \"boring\" compared to more responsive options.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">A highly upvoted r/BuyItForLife comment summarized the Brooks experience: \"My Brooks Glycerin or Adrenaline are the best. I used to wear New Balance 1080's or Adidas SuperNova, but been a Brooks fan for 4 years now. They don't lose form as quickly as other brands.\" This sentiment about long-term durability appears frequently in Brooks discussions.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">ASICS: The Performance Favorite</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-6\">ASICS receives praise for cushioning technology and responsiveness, particularly the Novablast and Gel-Nimbus lines. Reddit users often mention ASICS for runners with specific needs like plantar fasciitis or high arches. However, some users report shorter lifespan compared to Brooks, with cushioning feeling \"dead\" around 350-400 miles. The brand also gets mixed reviews for width, with some users finding them too narrow.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Nike: The Value and Versatility Pick</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-6\">Nike, particularly the Pegasus line, gets consistent recommendations for versatility and value. Reddit users appreciate Nike's frequent sales and outlet availability. Many users report excellent durability, with some Pegasus models lasting 800+ miles. The main criticism centers on the narrow fit for some foot shapes and occasionally flimsy laces. Users also note that <b><i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/reddit-best-running-shoes\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\">Nike sizing can be inconsistent</a></i></b> between different models.</p>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Section 4 -->\n            <section id=\"my-experience\" class=\"mb-12\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800\">My Experience Testing Reddit's Favorite Shoes</h2>\n                <img src=\"https://d1nymbkeomeoqg.cloudfront.net/photos/30/12/422677_24123_XL.jpg\" alt=\"Women's running shoes tested by expert reviewer\" class=\"w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-6 rounded-lg shadow-md\" style=\"height: auto;\">\n                \n                <p class=\"mb-6\">After reading thousands of Reddit comments, I decided to personally test the most recommended shoes over a six-month period. Living in Colorado, I had access to diverse terrain including mountain trails, city pavement, and park paths. Here's my honest experience with each highly-recommended model.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Brooks Ghost 15: The Reliable Companion</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">I started with the Brooks Ghost 15 based on overwhelming Reddit recommendations. After 300 miles of testing, I understand the hype. These shoes provide consistent comfort without being overly soft or unstable. During my summer training runs in Rocky Mountain National Park, they handled everything from paved trails to light gravel paths with confidence. The cushioning remained supportive even during my longest 18-mile training run.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">What surprised me was how \"invisible\" they felt - exactly what Reddit users meant when they said good running shoes shouldn't be noticed. I experienced zero hot spots or pressure points, even on first wear. However, I found them somewhat heavy for speed work, confirming Reddit users' comments about them being better for easy runs and long distances.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">ASICS Novablast 4: The Energy Booster</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">The ASICS Novablast 4 delivered the \"bouncy\" experience Reddit users constantly mention. During tempo runs on Denver's Cherry Creek Trail, I felt noticeable energy return that made maintaining pace easier. The shoe excelled during interval workouts and medium-distance runs (5-10 miles).</p>\n\n                <p class=\"mb-6\">However, I experienced the durability issues Reddit users mention. Around mile 250, the bouncy feel diminished significantly, though the shoe remained comfortable. For the price point, this earlier loss of performance characteristics was disappointing. I also noticed increased fatigue during very long runs, suggesting these work best for shorter, faster efforts as <b><i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-adidas-running-shoes-reddit\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\">many Reddit discussions indicate</a></i></b>.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Nike Pegasus 40: The Dependable Daily Trainer</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-6\">The Nike Pegasus 40 proved why it's Reddit's most recommended value option. Over 400 miles, it maintained consistent performance without any major issues. The fit was true to size, and the shoe handled everything from recovery jogs to moderate tempo runs. What impressed me most was the outsole durability - after extensive testing on concrete and asphalt, wear patterns were minimal. This aligns with Reddit users who report 500+ mile lifespans from Pegasus models.</p>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Section 5 -->\n            <section id=\"choosing-guide\" class=\"mb-12\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800\">How to Choose the Right Running Shoe Based on Reddit Wisdom</h2>\n                \n                <p class=\"mb-6\">Reddit's collective wisdom provides invaluable guidance for choosing running shoes, often contradicting retail sales tactics. Here's what thousands of experienced runners recommend for finding your perfect match.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">The Reddit-Approved Fitting Process</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">Reddit users consistently recommend visiting specialty running stores for professional fitting, but with important caveats. The most upvoted advice emphasizes trying multiple brands and models, not just accepting the first recommendation. Experienced Reddit runners suggest bringing your old shoes to show wear patterns and asking to run outside or on a treadmill, not just walking around the store.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">One highly-praised comment from r/beginnerrunning suggests the \"comparison test\": \"Put one model on one foot and another on the other foot, then walk around the store. Switch shoes and repeat. Buy the ones you were least aware of wearing.\" This practical advice appears in multiple threads and comes from runners with years of experience.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Understanding Your Foot Type</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">While Reddit users generally dismiss overly technical gait analysis, they emphasize understanding basic foot characteristics. Width is crucial - many women need wide sizes but don't realize it. Arch height affects comfort but doesn't necessarily dictate shoe type. Reddit discussions frequently mention that <b><i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-budget-running-shoes-reddit\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\">comfort trumps technical specifications</a></i></b> every time.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">Reddit users also emphasize timing - shop for shoes in the afternoon when feet are slightly swollen, mimicking conditions during longer runs. Size up a half or full size from regular shoes, and ensure thumb-width space between longest toe and shoe front.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">The Return Policy Strategy</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-6\">Smart Reddit users take advantage of generous return policies to truly test shoes. Many specialty stores offer 30-60 day return windows, even for worn shoes. Online retailers like Amazon and Zappos provide easy returns. The Reddit consensus is that you can't truly evaluate a running shoe with a 30-second store test - you need several runs to identify potential issues. This approach has saved many Reddit users from expensive mistakes and helped them find perfect fits they might have missed in-store.</p>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Section 6 -->\n            <section id=\"budget-options\" class=\"mb-12\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800\">Budget-Friendly Options Reddit Users Love</h2>\n                \n                <p class=\"mb-6\">Reddit's running communities excel at finding quality shoes at reasonable prices. Experienced users share strategies for getting premium shoes without premium prices, often through careful timing and smart shopping techniques.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">The Previous Model Strategy</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">The most frequently mentioned money-saving tip is buying previous year's models. As one r/AdvancedRunning user explained: \"I track sales and buy flagship models when they are in the $60-90 range. Really hard to get more economical ($/mile) than that.\" This strategy works particularly well with Nike Pegasus, Brooks Ghost, and ASICS models where changes between versions are often minimal.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">Reddit users recommend checking running warehouse outlets, brand websites' clearance sections, and Amazon for previous models. Many report getting $140 shoes for $70-80 with this approach. The key is knowing your size and preferred model, then setting up price alerts or checking regularly during transition periods when new models launch.</p>\n\n                <div class=\"bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4\">\n                    <p class=\"text-center\">\n                        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVXM7H4P?tag=natureguests00-20\" class=\"inline-block bg-yellow-600 hover:bg-yellow-700 text-white font-bold py-3 px-8 rounded-lg transition duration-300\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-tag mr-2\"></i>Find Brooks Adrenaline GTS 23 Deals\n                        </a>\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Outlet and Sale Timing</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">Reddit users have identified optimal timing for shoe purchases. End-of-season sales (late summer and late winter) offer the best discounts. Nike outlet stores consistently provide good deals on Pegasus models. Brooks and ASICS have regular online sales, often 25-40% off retail prices.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">Several Reddit users mention successful purchases from outlet malls, particularly Nike and Adidas outlets. One user shared: \"Nike outlet near me regularly has last year's Pegs for like $80. I really wish I liked them because that's the best deal per mile I know of.\" This highlights how location can affect available deals.</p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Reddit's Specific Budget Recommendations</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">For users seeking shoes under $100, Reddit consistently recommends the Nike Pegasus (especially previous models), New Balance 1080 v13 during sales, and Saucony Ride models. These shoes regularly appear in \"budget but quality\" discussions and have track records for durability.</p>\n\n                <div class=\"bg-purple-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n                    <p class=\"text-center\">\n                        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8YFH2J6?tag=natureguests00-20\" class=\"inline-block bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700 text-white font-bold py-3 px-8 rounded-lg transition duration-300\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-star mr-2\"></i>Check New Balance 1080 v14 Current Price\n                        </a>\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n\n                <p class=\"mb-6\">Reddit users also emphasize cost-per-mile calculations rather than upfront price. A $120 shoe lasting 600 miles costs 20 cents per mile, while a $60 shoe lasting 200 miles costs 30 cents per mile. This perspective helps justify spending more initially for better long-term value, especially for <b><i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-cheap-running-shoes-reddit\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\">high-mileage runners</a></i></b>.</p>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- User Reviews Section -->\n            <section class=\"mb-12 bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800\">Real User Review Summaries</h2>\n                \n                <div class=\"grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-6\">\n                    <div class=\"bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow\">\n                        <h4 class=\"font-semibold mb-2\">Sarah, Marathon Runner</h4>\n                        <div class=\"flex mb-2\">\n                            <span class=\"text-yellow-400\">★★★★★</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <p class=\"text-sm\">\"Brooks Ghost 15s carried me through my first marathon.

Reddit users consistently praise Brooks for durability and comfort, ASICS for bouncy responsiveness, and Nike Pegasus for versatility and value. The key recommendation from Reddit is to get professionally fitted at a specialty running store, as individual foot mechanics vary significantly between runners. Many users emphasize that <b><i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-running-shoe-reddit\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\">personal comfort should trump brand popularity</a></i></b> when making final decisions.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <div id=\"faq-2\" class=\"border-b pb-6\">\n                        <h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800\">Should I choose neutral or stability running shoes according to Reddit users?</h3>\n                        <p class=\"text-gray-700\">Reddit users and running experts overwhelmingly recommend starting with neutral shoes unless you have a specific medical reason for stability features. The concept of 'overpronation' is often overdiagnosed in retail settings, and most runners fall within normal pronation ranges. Reddit discussions emphasize that comfort should be the primary factor, and many users report better experiences with neutral shoes even if they were previously told they needed stability features. If you experience persistent pain or have a diagnosed gait issue, consult with a sports medicine professional rather than relying solely on in-store gait analysis. The consensus from <b><i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-trail-running-shoes-reddit\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\">experienced trail and road runners</a></i></b> is that proper fit matters more than stability technology for most people.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <div id=\"faq-3\" class=\"border-b pb-6\">\n                        <h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800\">How much should I spend on women's running shoes based on Reddit advice?</h3>\n                        <p class=\"text-gray-700\">Reddit users consistently recommend the $80-120 range for quality women's running shoes, emphasizing that expensive doesn't always mean better. Many experienced runners suggest buying previous year's models of flagship shoes during sales, which often brings premium shoes into this price range. The consensus is that spending less than $60 usually results in poor durability and comfort, while spending over $150 only makes sense for specialized racing shoes or if you have very specific foot requirements. Reddit users frequently share deals and discount strategies, with many getting premium shoes for $60-90 through outlet stores, end-of-season sales, and online retailers. The community emphasizes calculating cost per mile rather than focusing solely on upfront price.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <div id=\"faq-4\" class=\"border-b pb-6\">\n                        <h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800\">What's the best way to break in new running shoes according to Reddit?</h3>\n                        <p class=\"text-gray-700\">Reddit running communities emphasize that good running shoes should feel comfortable immediately and require minimal break-in time. The recommended approach is to wear new shoes for short walks first, then progress to short easy runs (1-2 miles) before using them for longer distances. Many Reddit users warn against the myth that shoes need extensive breaking in - if shoes cause pain or discomfort initially, they're likely not the right fit. The general timeline suggested is wearing shoes for daily activities for 3-5 days, followed by 2-3 short runs before committing to longer distances. Reddit users also recommend keeping your old shoes until you're confident the new ones work well, especially when transitioning to <b><i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-walking-shoes-for-women-reddit\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\">different shoe types or brands</a></i></b>.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <div id=\"faq-5\" class=\"border-b pb-6\">\n                        <h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800\">How often should I replace my running shoes according to Reddit discussions?</h3>\n                        <p class=\"text-gray-700\">Reddit users generally follow the 300-500 mile replacement guideline, but emphasize listening to your body over rigid mileage rules. Signs mentioned frequently include decreased cushioning leading to joint pain, uneven wear patterns, compressed midsole foam that doesn't bounce back, and visible outsole wear. Many Reddit users recommend rotating between 2-3 pairs of shoes to extend lifespan and reduce injury risk. Heavier runners may need to replace shoes closer to 300 miles, while lighter runners might get 500+ miles. Reddit discussions also highlight that some shoes like Brooks models tend to last longer (600-800 miles) while others like ASICS may feel 'dead' around 350-400 miles, varying by individual running style and body weight. Users consistently recommend tracking mileage and replacing shoes before experiencing pain or discomfort, as continued use of worn shoes can lead to injuries.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n\n            <!-- Additional CTA -->\n            <section class=\"mb-12 text-center\">\n                <div class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-green-500 p-8 rounded-lg text-white\">\n                    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold mb-4\">Ready to Find Your Perfect Running Shoes?</h3>\n                    <p class=\"mb-6\">Don't let decision paralysis keep you from running.

Instead, they're identified through the collective wisdom of real runners who've logged countless miles in pursuit of comfort, performance, and value.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"mb-6\">The consistent themes from Reddit discussions - prioritizing proper fit over brand loyalty, starting with neutral shoes, investing in professional fitting, and focusing on individual comfort - provide a roadmap for any woman seeking her ideal running shoe. Whether you're drawn to the reliability of Brooks Ghost, the responsiveness of ASICS Novablast, or the versatility of Nike Pegasus, the key is finding what works for your unique feet and running style.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"mb-6\">Remember that even the most highly-rated shoe won't work for everyone. Use Reddit's recommendations as a starting point, but trust your own experience above all else. Take advantage of generous return policies, rotate multiple pairs if your budget allows, and don't be afraid to try something different if your current shoes aren't meeting your needs.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"mb-6\">Most importantly, Reddit's running communities remind us that the best running shoe is the one that gets you out the door consistently and comfortably. Whether you're training for your first 5K or your fiftieth marathon, the right shoes are out there - and now you have the knowledge to find them.
