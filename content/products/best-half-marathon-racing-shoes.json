They should provide enough cushioning for 13.1 miles while maintaining a fast, efficient feel that doesn't compromise your natural running form during the 60-120 minute race duration. The key is finding the sweet spot between speed and comfort that sustains performance throughout the entire distance.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div class=\"bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg\">\n                    <h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-900\">Should I choose carbon-plated shoes for my half marathon?</h3>\n                    <p class=\"text-gray-700\">Carbon-plated shoes can provide significant benefits for half marathon racing, including improved running economy and reduced energy expenditure. However, they work best for runners who can maintain faster paces (sub-7:00/mile) and have adapted to the firm, responsive feel. If you're a recreational runner or prefer softer cushioning, traditional racing shoes without plates might be more comfortable and suitable for your needs. The adaptation period is crucial - don't expect immediate comfort or performance gains without proper break-in time.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div class=\"bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md\">\n                    <h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-900\">How far in advance should I buy my half marathon racing shoes?</h3>\n                    <p class=\"text-gray-700\">Purchase your half marathon racing shoes at least 4-6 weeks before race day to allow proper break-in time. Use them for several shorter runs and one or two tempo workouts to ensure comfort and identify any potential issues. Never debut brand new shoes on race day, as this significantly increases your risk of blisters, hot spots, or other discomfort that could derail your race performance. The adaptation period is especially important for carbon-plated models, which require time to feel natural and comfortable.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div class=\"bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg\">\n                    <h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-900\">What's the difference between training shoes and racing shoes for half marathons?</h3>\n                    <p class=\"text-gray-700\">Half marathon racing shoes prioritize speed and efficiency over durability and daily comfort. They're typically lighter (6-8.5 oz vs 9-12 oz), have more responsive midsole materials, aggressive outsole designs for traction, and often feature racing-specific technologies like carbon plates. Training shoes emphasize cushioning, durability, and comfort for high-mileage use, while racing shoes are designed for peak performance over shorter durations. The geometry is also more aggressive in racing shoes, with features like rocker profiles and firmer midsoles that enhance forward propulsion but may feel unstable for everyday running.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div class=\"bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md\">\n                    <h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-900\">Can I use my half marathon racing shoes for training runs?</h3>\n                    <p class=\"text-gray-700\">While possible, it's not recommended to use racing shoes for regular training. Racing shoes are designed for speed and typically lack the durability and cushioning needed for high-mileage training. Using them sparingly for tempo runs, interval workouts, or tune-up races helps preserve their lifespan and ensures they're in optimal condition for race day. Save your racing shoes for when you need maximum performance. Most racing shoes will last 200-400 miles compared to 400-600 miles for training shoes, so using them for daily training significantly reduces their racing effectiveness.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n\n        <section id=\"conclusion\" class=\"mb-12\">\n            <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-900\">Conclusion</h2>\n            \n            <p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-6\">Selecting the best half marathon racing shoes represents a critical decision that can significantly impact your race day performance and enjoyment.
