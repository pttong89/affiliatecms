This comprehensive guide shares my personal experiences and extensive research to help you discover the <strong>best ASICS shoes for standing all day</strong>.

The Japanese brand's motto \"Anima Sana In Corpore Sano\" (a sound mind in a sound body) isn't just marketing—it reflects their genuine commitment to foot health and comfort.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.runrepeat.com/storage/gallery/buying_guide_primary/1983/1983-best-asics-walking-shoes-19632057-main.jpg\" alt=\"ASICS shoes designed for all-day comfort and support\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n\n<p>What sets ASICS apart for standing all day is their focus on three critical elements: <strong>superior cushioning technology</strong>, <strong>anatomical foot support</strong>, and <strong>proven durability</strong>. Their renowned GEL technology, combined with newer innovations like FF BLAST foam, creates a perfect balance of shock absorption and energy return that your feet will appreciate during those marathon work days.</p>\n\n<p>From my experience working long shifts at national parks, where I'm constantly on my feet guiding tours and patrolling trails, I've learned that the right footwear isn't just about comfort—it's about maintaining your energy levels and preventing the foot fatigue that can affect your entire body. ASICS consistently delivers on this front, which is why they're recommended by podiatrists and trusted by professionals worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>Several ASICS models have even received the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) Seal of Acceptance, including the <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-shoes-for-standing-all-day\" style=\"color: #2c5aa0; text-decoration: none;\"><i>Gel-Nimbus and Gel-Kayano series</i></a>, confirming their beneficial impact on foot health.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"top-picks\"><i class=\"fas fa-trophy\"></i> Top 7 Best ASICS Shoes for Standing All Day</h2>\n\n<h3><i class=\"fas fa-medal\"></i> 1. ASICS Gel-Nimbus 27 - The Ultimate All-Day Comfort Champion</h3>\n\n<p>After wearing the Gel-Nimbus 27 during several 10-hour park patrol shifts, I can understand why it's considered the gold standard for all-day comfort. With its impressive 42.7mm heel stack and PureGEL technology, this shoe transforms even the hardest concrete surfaces into something manageable.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://bcaba076.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/241219_Pictures_Asics_Nimbus27-13-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"ASICS Gel-Nimbus 27 shoes perfect for standing all day at work\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 15px 0;\">\n\n<p><strong><i class=\"fas fa-check-circle\" style=\"color: #28a745;\"></i> Key Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><i class=\"fas fa-leaf\" style=\"color: #28a745;\"></i> Maximum FF BLAST PLUS ECO cushioning (made from 24% bio-based materials)</li>\n<li><i class=\"fas fa-shield-alt\" style=\"color: #2c5aa0;\"></i> PureGEL technology in heel for superior shock absorption</li>\n<li><i class=\"fas fa-wind\" style=\"color: #17a2b8;\"></i> Exceptional breathability with 4/5 lab-tested rating</li>\n<li><i class=\"fas fa-balance-scale\" style=\"color: #6610f2;\"></i> Wide platform for enhanced stability</li>\n<li><i class=\"fas fa-gem\" style=\"color: #fd7e14;\"></i> Premium jacquard mesh upper for all-day comfort</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><i class=\"fas fa-users\"></i> Perfect for:</strong> Healthcare workers, retail employees, and anyone requiring maximum cushioning for extended standing periods.</p>\n\n<div class=\"review-box\" style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-quote-left\" style=\"color: #2c5aa0;\"></i> \"I've been using these shoes for my 12-hour nursing shifts, and they're a game-changer.

ASICS Gel-Kayano 32 - The Stability Powerhouse</h3>\n\n<p>For those with flat feet or overpronation issues, the Gel-Kayano 32 has been my go-to recommendation. During my ranger training days, a colleague with severe overpronation swore by these shoes, and after trying them myself, I understood why.</p>\n\n<p>The revolutionary 4D Guidance System provides adaptive support without the rigid, uncomfortable feeling of traditional stability shoes. At 39.9mm heel height, it offers substantial cushioning while maintaining excellent ground contact and control.</p>\n\n<p><strong><i class=\"fas fa-cogs\"></i> Key Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><i class=\"fas fa-compass\" style=\"color: #2c5aa0;\"></i> 4D Guidance System for intelligent stability</li>\n<li><i class=\"fas fa-cloud\" style=\"color: #17a2b8;\"></i> FF BLAST PLUS ECO foam for plush comfort</li>\n<li><i class=\"fas fa-shoe-prints\" style=\"color: #28a745;\"></i> PureGEL heel insert for smooth landings</li>\n<li><i class=\"fas fa-grip-horizontal\" style=\"color: #dc3545;\"></i> Excellent traction with 0.84 friction score</li>\n<li><i class=\"fas fa-expand-arrows-alt\" style=\"color: #6610f2;\"></i> Wide 119.8/97.2mm platform for stability</li>\n</ul>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPLQW636?tag=natureguests00-20\" class=\"amazon-button\"><i class=\"fab fa-amazon\"></i> Check Latest Price on Amazon</a>\n\n<h3><i class=\"fas fa-running\"></i> 3. ASICS Gel-Cumulus 27 - The Versatile Daily Driver</h3>\n\n<p>The Gel-Cumulus 27 represents the sweet spot between comfort and responsiveness. At just 9.2 oz, it's surprisingly light for its 40.9mm stack height, making it ideal for those who want cushioning without the bulk.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.runrepeat.com/storage/gallery/product_primary/40699/asics-gel-cumulus-27-22918744-main.jpg\" alt=\"ASICS Gel-Cumulus 27 lightweight comfort shoes for all-day standing\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 15px 0;\">\n\n<p>I've found this model particularly effective during spring and fall seasons when breathability isn't as critical. The FF BLAST+ foam provides excellent shock absorption while maintaining enough responsiveness for those moments when you need to move quickly.</p>\n\n<p><strong><i class=\"fas fa-users\"></i> Perfect for:</strong> Teachers, security guards, and anyone who needs to balance standing with occasional walking or movement.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3XTLP7Q?tag=natureguests00-20\" class=\"amazon-button\"><i class=\"fab fa-amazon\"></i> Check Latest Price on Amazon</a>\n\n<h3><i class=\"fas fa-dollar-sign\"></i> 4. ASICS GT-1000 13 - The Budget-Friendly Champion</h3>\n\n<p>Don't let the lower price fool you—the GT-1000 13 delivers exceptional value for money.

When selecting the <strong>best ASICS shoes for standing all day</strong>, prioritize these elements:</p>\n\n<h3><i class=\"fas fa-cloud\"></i> Cushioning Technology</h3>\n\n<p>The foundation of all-day comfort lies in superior cushioning. ASICS uses several advanced technologies:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-gem\" style=\"color: #2c5aa0;\"></i> GEL Technology:</strong> Provides excellent shock absorption, particularly in the heel area</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-rocket\" style=\"color: #17a2b8;\"></i> FF BLAST+ Foam:</strong> Offers responsive cushioning with good energy return</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-star\" style=\"color: #ffc107;\"></i> PureGEL:</strong> Latest evolution providing 65% softer landings than traditional GEL</li>\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.asics.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-asics-au-Library/default/dw3fa67640/firstspirit/media/new_folder/new_folder_109/running-shoes-vs-walking-shoes.jpg\" alt=\"ASICS cushioning technology comparison for standing comfort\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 700px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 15px 0;\">\n\n<h3><i class=\"fas fa-balance-scale\"></i> Arch Support and Stability</h3>\n\n<p>Proper arch support prevents fatigue and maintains foot alignment during extended standing. Look for features like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-compass\" style=\"color: #2c5aa0;\"></i> 4D/3D Guidance Systems:</strong> Provide intelligent stability without rigid medial posts</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-layer-group\" style=\"color: #17a2b8;\"></i> DUOMAX Technology:</strong> Dual-density midsole for enhanced support</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-lock\" style=\"color: #28a745;\"></i> External heel clutch:</strong> Improves heel lockdown and stability</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From my experience, the <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-shoes-for-standing-walking-all-day\" style=\"color: #2c5aa0; text-decoration: none;\"><b>right stability features</b></a> can prevent the lower back pain that often develops from poor foot alignment during long standing periods.</p>\n\n<h3><i class=\"fas fa-wind\"></i> Breathability and Material Quality</h3>\n\n<p>During summer ranger duties in hot climates, I've learned that breathability is crucial for comfort and foot health. Quality ASICS models feature:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-air-freshener\" style=\"color: #17a2b8;\"></i> Engineered mesh uppers:</strong> Promote airflow while maintaining structure</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-tint\" style=\"color: #2c5aa0;\"></i> Moisture-wicking linings:</strong> Keep feet dry and comfortable</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-shield-virus\" style=\"color: #28a745;\"></i> Antimicrobial treatments:</strong> Reduce odor development during long wear periods</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"experience\"><i class=\"fas fa-user-check\"></i> My Personal Experience</h2>\n\n<p>During my decade-long career in national park services, I've put countless pairs of shoes through the ultimate test: 12-hour shifts on unforgiving terrain. My relationship with ASICS began somewhat by accident when a colleague recommended the Gel-Nimbus 24 after I complained about persistent foot pain during my first summer season.</p>\n\n<div class=\"experience-box\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #2c5aa0; margin-top: 0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-map-marker-alt\"></i> Real-World Testing Conditions</h3>\n<p>My testing environment includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-building\"></i> Concrete visitor centers:</strong> 8-10 hours of standing on hard surfaces</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-tools\"></i> Trail maintenance:</strong> Mixed terrain with constant walking and standing</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-users\"></i> Guided tours:</strong> 4-6 hour periods of continuous movement and explanation stops</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-thermometer-half\"></i> Weather extremes:</strong> From desert heat to mountain snow conditions</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p>The transformation was immediate. Within the first week of wearing the Gel-Nimbus, I noticed significantly less leg fatigue and virtually no foot pain at the end of my shifts. This experience led me to test multiple ASICS models over the years, each in different seasonal and terrain conditions.</p>\n\n<p>One particularly challenging test came during a busy summer season at Yellowstone, where I wore the Gel-Kayano 31 for an entire month of 10-hour days. The stability features proved invaluable when standing on uneven ground during wildlife presentations, while the cushioning handled the constant concrete contact at the visitor center.</p>\n\n<p>What consistently impresses me about ASICS is their attention to the small details that matter during extended wear. The <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-comfortable-shoes-for-standing-all-day\" style=\"color: #2c5aa0; text-decoration: none;\"><i>heel lockdown systems</i></a> prevent that annoying slippage that can cause hot spots, while the toe box designs provide enough room for natural foot swelling that occurs during long standing periods.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"buying-guide\"><i class=\"fas fa-shopping-cart\"></i> Professional Buying Guide</h2>\n\n<p>Selecting the perfect ASICS shoes for standing all day requires careful consideration of several factors. Based on my extensive experience helping park staff and visitors choose appropriate footwear, here's my professional guidance:</p>\n\n<h3><i class=\"fas fa-ruler\"></i> Sizing and Fit Considerations</h3>\n\n<p>Proper fit is absolutely critical for all-day comfort. ASICS tends to run true to size, but there are important considerations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-clock\"></i> Measure your feet in the afternoon:</strong> Feet naturally swell during the day, simulating work conditions</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-expand-arrows-alt\"></i> Consider wide options:</strong> Many ASICS models come in 2E and 4E widths</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-socks\"></i> Account for compression socks:</strong> If you wear compression socks for work, size accordingly</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-shoe-prints\"></i> Test with orthotics:</strong> If you use custom insoles, bring them when trying on shoes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"pro-tip\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\"><strong><i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb\"></i> Pro Tip:</strong> Order two consecutive sizes if you're between sizes. Most retailers offer easy returns, and the small investment is worth finding the perfect fit.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3><i class=\"fas fa-foot-print\"></i> Understanding Your Foot Type</h3>\n\n<p>Your foot type significantly influences which ASICS model will work best:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-equals\"></i> Normal arches:</strong> Gel-Nimbus or Gel-Cumulus series work well</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-level-down-alt\"></i> Flat feet/overpronation:</strong> Gel-Kayano or GT series provide necessary support</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-level-up-alt\"></i> High arches:</strong> Maximum cushioning models like Gel-Nimbus are ideal</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-expand\"></i> Wide feet:</strong> Look for models specifically available in wide sizes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>During park orientation sessions, I always recommend the <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-footwear-for-standing-all-day\" style=\"color: #2c5aa0; text-decoration: none;\"><b>\"wet foot test\"</b></a> to help new employees understand their arch type—simply step out of a shower onto a piece of paper and examine the footprint pattern.</p>\n\n<h3><i class=\"fas fa-briefcase\"></i> Professional vs. Casual Use Considerations</h3>\n\n<p>Different work environments require different approaches:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-user-md\"></i> Healthcare/Medical:</strong> Prioritize easy cleaning and slip-resistance (Gel-Nimbus, Gel-Kayano)</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-store\"></i> Retail/Hospitality:</strong> Balance comfort with professional appearance (Gel-Cumulus, GT-1000)</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-industry\"></i> Industrial/Warehouse:</strong> Focus on durability and safety features (GT-2000, Gel-Pulse)</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-graduation-cap\"></i> Education:</strong> Versatility for mixed standing and walking (Gel-Contend, Gel-Cumulus)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For those working in multiple environments, I often recommend having two pairs and rotating them. This approach extends shoe life while allowing one pair to fully decompress between wears.</p>\n\n<h3><i class=\"fas fa-calendar-check\"></i> Break-in Period and Adaptation</h3>\n\n<p>Even the best ASICS shoes require a proper break-in period. My recommended approach:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-calendar-week\"></i> Week 1:</strong> Wear for 2-3 hours daily during non-work activities</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-calendar\"></i> Week 2:</strong> Extend to half-shifts or shorter work periods</li>\n<li><strong><i class=\"fas fa-calendar-plus\"></i> Week 3+:</strong> Full work shifts with confidence</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This gradual approach prevents blisters and allows your feet to adapt to the new support structure. I've seen too many people dismiss excellent shoes because they rushed the break-in process.</p>\n\n<div class=\"review-box\" style=\"background-color: #d4edda; border-left: 4px solid #28a745;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-quote-left\" style=\"color: #28a745;\"></i> \"The break-in advice saved me! I almost returned my Gel-Kayanos after the first day, but following the gradual approach made them my favorite work shoes.\" <strong>- Jennifer L., Physical Therapist</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Remember that quality footwear is an investment in your health and job performance. When you consider the cost per wear over the typical 300-500 mile lifespan of ASICS shoes, even premium models like the Gel-Nimbus 27 represent excellent value for the comfort and health benefits they provide.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"faq\"><i class=\"fas fa-question-circle\"></i> Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n\n<h3><i class=\"fas fa-calendar-alt\"></i> How long do ASICS shoes typically last when used for standing all day?</h3>\n\n<p>Based on my extensive field testing and experience with park staff, ASICS shoes typically last 300-500 miles or approximately 6-8 months of regular full-time use when standing all day. However, this varies significantly based on several factors including your body weight, standing surface type, and specific model durability features.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, the premium models like the Gel-Nimbus and Gel-Kayano series tend to exceed this range, often lasting 8-10 months with proper care. The key is monitoring the midsole compression rather than just outer appearance. I always recommend having a backup pair ready when you notice decreased cushioning performance, as this typically indicates the foam has reached its compression limit.</p>\n\n<p>For maximum lifespan, I suggest rotating between two pairs, allowing each to fully decompress between wears. This practice can extend total shoe life by 30-40% while maintaining consistent comfort levels.</p>\n\n<h3><i class=\"fas fa-foot-print\"></i> Are ASICS shoes suitable for people with plantar fasciitis?</h3>\n\n<p>Yes, several ASICS models are excellent choices for plantar fasciitis sufferers. During my career, I've worked with numerous colleagues who've found significant relief using specific ASICS models. The Gel-Nimbus and Gel-Kayano series, both APMA-approved, provide the crucial combination of heel cushioning and arch support needed for plantar fasciitis management.</p>\n\n<p>The key features that make ASICS effective for this condition include: the PureGEL heel cushioning that reduces impact stress, structured arch support systems that prevent excessive stretching of the plantar fascia, and the wide platform design that provides stability and reduces pressure concentration.</p>\n\n<p>However, I always recommend consulting with a podiatrist before making footwear decisions for medical conditions. Many healthcare providers specifically recommend ASICS for plantar fasciitis patients, but individual needs vary. Custom orthotics can often be accommodated in ASICS shoes, particularly in models with removable insoles like the <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-brooks-shoes-for-standing-all-day\" style=\"color: #2c5aa0; text-decoration: none;\"><i>Gel-Kayano series</i></a>.</p>\n\n<h3><i class=\"fas fa-running\"></i> What's the difference between ASICS running shoes and walking shoes for standing all day?</h3>\n\n<p>From my practical experience testing both categories, the differences are more subtle than many people realize. ASICS running shoes often work excellently for standing all day because they're designed for repetitive impact absorption—exactly what your feet experience during extended standing periods.</p>\n\n<p>The main distinctions include: running shoes typically offer more sophisticated cushioning technologies like FF BLAST+ foam and PureGEL, generally provide better energy return for those who need to move quickly during work, and often have superior breathability for extended wear comfort.</p>\n\n<p>Walking-specific ASICS shoes tend to have firmer heel construction for stability, more durable outsole rubber compounds, and sometimes more conservative styling for professional environments. However, many of the models I recommend, like the Gel-Nimbus and Gel-Cumulus, blur these lines effectively.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, I've found that ASICS running shoes from their comfort-focused lines (Nimbus, Cumulus, Kayano) perform better for standing all day than their dedicated walking shoes. The advanced cushioning technologies developed for running translate perfectly to standing comfort needs.</p>\n\n<h3><i class=\"fas fa-balance-scale\"></i> How do I know if I need stability features in my ASICS shoes?</h3>\n\n<p>Determining if you need stability features is crucial for long-term comfort and injury prevention. During park training sessions, I teach the \"wet foot test\" where you step out of a shower onto paper—if you see a complete footprint with no arch curve, you likely need stability support.</p>\n\n<p>Physical indicators that suggest you need stability features include: shoes wearing unevenly on the inside edge, knee or hip discomfort after long standing periods, feet that roll inward noticeably when viewed from behind, and a history of ankle injuries or instability.</p>\n\n<p>From my experience, even people who don't technically overpronate can benefit from mild stability features during extended standing. The 4D Guidance System in shoes like the Gel-Kayano 32 provides adaptive support that helps maintain proper alignment without the rigid feel of traditional stability shoes.</p>\n\n<p>If you're unsure, I recommend starting with a neutral model like the Gel-Nimbus and monitoring your comfort levels. Many specialty running stores also offer gait analysis services that can definitively determine your pronation pattern. The investment in proper assessment pays dividends in long-term foot health and comfort.</p>\n\n<h3><i class=\"fas fa-shoe-prints\"></i> Can I use custom orthotics with ASICS shoes?</h3>\n\n<p>Absolutely, and this combination often provides the ultimate in all-day standing comfort. Most ASICS models feature removable insoles that can accommodate custom orthotics, though some models work better than others for this purpose.</p>\n\n<p>Based on my experience with park staff who use orthotics, the best ASICS models for custom insoles include: Gel-Kayano series (excellent volume and structure), GT-2000 series (good depth and stability), and Gel-Nimbus models (maximum cushioning foundation). The key is ensuring adequate volume in the shoe to accommodate both your foot and the orthotic without creating pressure points.</p>\n\n<p>When using orthotics, I recommend going up half a size from your normal ASICS size to account for the additional volume. Also, choose models with neutral or mild stability features, as your orthotics will provide the primary support structure. The <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-hoka-shoes-for-standing-all-day\" style=\"color: #2c5aa0; text-decoration: none;\"><i>combination of ASICS cushioning technology</i></a> with properly fitted orthotics creates an exceptional foundation for all-day standing comfort.</p>\n\n<h3><i class=\"fas fa-soap\"></i> What's the best way to clean and maintain ASICS shoes for work use?</h3>\n\n<p>Proper maintenance significantly extends shoe life and maintains hygiene standards, especially important in healthcare and food service environments. My maintenance routine, developed through years of outdoor work, includes several key practices.</p>\n\n<p>For daily cleaning: remove laces and insoles, brush away surface dirt with a soft bristle brush, use mild soap and warm water for deep cleaning, and avoid harsh chemicals that can break down materials. For the midsole, gentle scrubbing with an old toothbrush removes stubborn stains without damaging the foam structure.</p>\n\n<p>Drying is crucial—never use direct heat sources like radiators or hair dryers, as this can damage the cushioning foam. Instead, stuff shoes with newspaper to absorb moisture and maintain shape, then air dry in a well-ventilated area. I always recommend having two pairs for rotation, allowing 24-48 hours between wears for complete moisture evaporation.</p>\n\n<p>For odor prevention, use antimicrobial sprays designed for athletic shoes, replace insoles periodically (especially if using over-the-counter options), and consider UV sanitizing systems if working in high-contamination environments. Proper maintenance can extend ASICS shoe life by 20-30% while maintaining hygiene standards required in professional settings.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\"><i class=\"fas fa-check-circle\"></i> Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>After years of testing and recommending footwear to countless professionals who spend their days on their feet, I can confidently state that the right ASICS shoes can transform your work experience. The <strong>best ASICS shoes for standing all day</strong> combine advanced cushioning technology, intelligent support systems, and proven durability to keep your feet comfortable from clock-in to clock-out.</p>\n\n<p>My top recommendation for most people is the <strong><i class=\"fas fa-star\" style=\"color: #ffc107;\"></i> ASICS Gel-Nimbus 27</strong>.
