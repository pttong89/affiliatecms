These distinctive boots emerged from the practical need for durable, protective footwear that could withstand the aggressive environment of punk shows, while simultaneously making a bold aesthetic statement that challenged mainstream fashion norms.</p>\n<p>The defining characteristics of punk boots include heavy-duty construction with multiple eyelets (typically 8-20), steel or reinforced toe caps for protection, thick rubber or lug soles for traction, and distinctive design elements like buckles, studs, chains, or straps. Unlike regular boots, punk boots prioritize both functionality and aggressive aesthetics, often featuring black leather or vegan alternatives with hardware that creates a militaristic, rebellious appearance.</p>\n<p>What makes punk boots truly special is their cultural significance within alternative subcultures. They serve as visual markers of belonging, worn by punks, goths, metalheads, and other alternative communities as badges of nonconformity. The choice to wear punk boots communicates an rejection of mainstream fashion and an embrace of countercultural values.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #fff3cd; border: 1px solid #ffeaa7; border-radius: 8px; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0; font-style: italic;\"><strong>Personal Insight:</strong> After wearing punk boots daily for over 15 years, I can attest that they're not just fashion statements—they're practical armor for navigating both literal and metaphorical battlefields. From mosh pits to everyday urban environments, the right pair becomes an extension of your identity.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The modern punk boot market spans from budget-friendly military surplus options under $50 to premium handcrafted boots exceeding $400. Popular materials include traditional black leather, vegan alternatives, patent leather, and even exotic options with metallic finishes or colored accents. Understanding this spectrum helps you make informed decisions based on your budget, ethical preferences, and style goals.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"evolution-punk-footwear\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #d63384; font-size: 2em; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #d63384; padding-bottom: 10px;\">The Evolution of Punk Footwear Culture</h2>\n<p>The history of punk boots traces back to the mid-1970s when early punk rockers adopted military surplus combat boots as affordable, durable footwear that aligned with their anti-establishment aesthetic. These original combat boots, often purchased from army surplus stores for under $20, became the foundation of punk footwear culture. Bands like The Ramones and The Sex Pistols popularized this look, transforming functional military gear into symbols of rebellion.</p>\n<p>The 1980s marked a pivotal evolution when Dr. Martens entered the punk scene. Originally designed as working-class footwear in post-war Britain, Doc Martens' distinctive yellow stitching, air-cushioned soles, and durable leather construction resonated with punk's working-class ethos. The brand's adoption by British punk and skinhead subcultures cemented its place in alternative fashion history, though this relationship would become complicated as the brand commercialized.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #495057; font-size: 1.5em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">The Rise of Specialized Punk Boot Brands</h3>\n<p>As punk culture matured through the 1990s and 2000s, specialized manufacturers emerged to serve the alternative fashion market. Brands like Steel Boots from Eastern Europe, Demonia's platform-heavy designs, and Gripfast's premium ranger boots offered options specifically designed for punk aesthetics rather than military function. This period saw the introduction of extreme platform soles, elaborate buckle systems, and gothic design elements that pushed punk boots beyond their combat boot origins.</p>\n<p>The digital age revolutionized punk boot accessibility. Online retailers like Rivithead, Tragic Beautiful, and specialized alternative fashion sites made previously hard-to-find brands globally available. This democratization of access meant punk boot enthusiasts no longer needed to rely solely on local shops or military surplus stores, dramatically expanding style options and brand competition.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f5e8; border: 1px solid #c3e6cb; border-radius: 8px; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\"><strong>Cultural Impact:</strong> According to research from alternative fashion historians, punk boots have influenced mainstream fashion multiple times, with major fashion houses regularly drawing inspiration from punk aesthetics for runway collections and commercial designs.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Today's punk boot landscape reflects both historical influences and modern innovations. Vegan leather options cater to ethical consumers, while traditional leather craftsmanship maintains quality standards. The resurgence of vintage military surplus reflects punk's DIY ethos, while premium brands like Solovair offer handcrafted quality for serious enthusiasts. Understanding this evolution helps appreciate why certain brands command respect within punk communities while others are viewed as commercialized alternatives.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"top-punk-boot-brands\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #d63384; font-size: 2em; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #d63384; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Top Punk Boot Brands and My Personal Reviews</h2>\n<img alt=\"Demonia Valor-240 skull buckle combat boots with gothic punk design elements\" src=\"https://images.rivithead.com/products/34/828/valor-240.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 400px; height: 350px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px; float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\">\n<p>After testing dozens of punk boot brands over 15+ years in the scene, I've developed strong opinions about which companies deliver genuine quality versus those trading on image alone. This comprehensive breakdown covers the major players, from legendary brands to modern alternatives, with honest assessments based on real-world wear testing.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #495057; font-size: 1.5em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">Military Surplus: The Original Punk Choice</h3>\n<p>Military surplus combat boots remain the gold standard for authentic punk footwear, particularly Corcoran brand jump boots. These boots offer unmatched durability, steel toe protection, and prices starting around $15-50 at thrift stores or surplus outlets. I've worn surplus boots through countless shows, and they consistently outlast more expensive alternatives. The authentic military construction means they're built for actual combat conditions, making mosh pits feel like casual strolls. However, age varies significantly, so inspect carefully for sole separation or excessive wear.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #495057; font-size: 1.5em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">Doc Martens: The Complicated Legacy</h3>\n<p>Doc Martens deserves separate analysis for their Made in England versus offshore production lines. Original UK-made Doc Martens (identifiable by \"Made in England\" stamping) represent genuine craftsmanship with superior leather, construction, and durability. These boots justify their $200+ price tags and develop beautiful patina over time. However, modern Asian-manufactured Doc Martens often disappoint with inferior materials and construction shortcuts. The brand's pivot toward fashion-forward designs has alienated many punk traditionalists who prefer the classic 8-14 eyelet combat styles.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;\">\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0749GS9G2?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #d63384, #dc3545); color: white; padding: 15px 30px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 25px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 1px; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(214, 51, 132, 0.4); transition: all 0.3s ease;\">Shop Premium Combat Boots on Amazon</a>\n</div>\n<h3 style=\"color: #495057; font-size: 1.5em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">Solovair: The Doc Martens Alternative</h3>\n<p>Solovair represents what Doc Martens should have remained—authentic British-made boots crafted in the original factories that produced Doc Martens until the mid-2000s. These boots offer superior construction, traditional designs, and quality that justifies their premium pricing. While expensive ($250-350), Solovair boots are investment pieces that improve with age and can be resoled by skilled cobblers. For punk purists seeking the classic Doc Martens experience without compromising on quality, Solovair is the clear choice.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #495057; font-size: 1.5em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">Steel Boots: Eastern European Engineering</h3>\n<p>Steel Boots from Eastern Europe offers extensive color options and eyelet configurations that appeal to punk aesthetics. Their steel toe caps and affordable pricing ($80-150) make them popular among budget-conscious punks. However, quality control varies significantly, with some pairs lasting years while others develop issues within months. The brand's customer service has historically been problematic, so purchase through reliable retailers rather than direct from manufacturer.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #495057; font-size: 1.5em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">Demonia: Platform Punk Evolution</h3>\n<p>Demonia revolutionized punk boots by introducing extreme platform soles, gothic design elements, and extensive style variations. Their boots range from subtle combat styles to towering platform creations reaching 4+ inches. Quality has improved significantly since the early 2000s, though construction still favors fashion over longevity. Demonia excels for special occasions, shows, or fashion statements but may not withstand daily wear like military-grade alternatives. Prices range from $100-200, representing decent value for the dramatic aesthetic impact.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"choosing-right-style\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #d63384; font-size: 2em; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #d63384; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Choosing the Right Style for Your Look</h2>\n<p>Selecting the perfect punk boots requires balancing aesthetic preferences, practical needs, and budget constraints. Your choice should reflect your personal style within punk subculture while providing the functionality needed for your lifestyle. This comprehensive guide breaks down the decision-making process to help you find boots that enhance both your appearance and daily experience.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #495057; font-size: 1.5em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">Combat vs. Platform: Understanding the Fundamental Split</h3>\n<p>Punk boots broadly divide into two categories: traditional combat-style boots and platform variations. Combat boots prioritize functionality with features like steel toes, multiple eyelets (8-20), and thick lug soles for traction. These boots work well for daily wear, concerts, and outdoor activities. Platform boots emphasize dramatic height and visual impact, often featuring 2-6 inch platform soles, gothic details, and elaborate buckle systems. Choose combat boots for versatility and durability, platform boots for fashion statements and special occasions.</p>\n<p>Consider your lifestyle when choosing between styles. If you walk long distances, work physical jobs, or attend many concerts, combat boots provide superior comfort and protection. For primarily indoor or fashion-focused wear, platform boots offer the dramatic aesthetic impact that defines alternative fashion. Many serious punk boot enthusiasts own multiple pairs for different occasions rather than trying to find one boot that serves all purposes.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #495057; font-size: 1.5em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">Material Considerations: Leather vs. Vegan Alternatives</h3>\n<img alt=\"Vintage punk combat boots showing classic 10-eyelet design with steel toe and authentic punk aesthetic\" src=\"https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/jbMAAOSwbCZkwXyG/s-l1200.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 400px; height: 350px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px; float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\">\n<p>Traditional leather remains the gold standard for punk boots due to its durability, breathability, and ability to develop character with wear. Quality leather boots mold to your feet over time, creating personalized comfort while developing unique patina that tells your story. However, ethical concerns have led many punks to embrace vegan alternatives made from synthetic materials or plant-based leathers.</p>\n<p>Modern vegan boot materials have dramatically improved, offering durability comparable to leather while aligning with cruelty-free values. Brands like <i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/vegan-boots\" style=\"color: #d63384;\">Vegetarian Shoes</a></i> produce high-quality vegan punk boots that satisfy both ethical and aesthetic requirements. Consider vegan options if animal welfare concerns outweigh traditional leather benefits, but research specific brands for quality assurance since vegan materials vary widely in durability.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;\">\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PP14G3J?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #6f42c1, #d63384); color: white; padding: 15px 30px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 25px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 1px; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(111, 66, 193, 0.4); transition: all 0.3s ease;\">Discover Vegan Punk Boots Collection</a>\n</div>\n<h3 style=\"color: #495057; font-size: 1.5em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">Sizing and Fit: Critical Considerations</h3>\n<p>Proper fit is crucial for punk boots since poor fitting can cause discomfort during long wear periods common at concerts or daily use. Most punk boot brands run differently than mainstream footwear, so research specific brand sizing recommendations before purchasing. Steel-toed boots require additional toe room to accommodate the protective cap without cramping. Platform boots may affect your gait and balance, requiring adjustment periods for comfortable wear.</p>\n<p>Consider purchasing from retailers with good return policies for first-time brand purchases. Many punk boot enthusiasts recommend buying a half-size larger than normal shoe size to accommodate thick socks or insoles, especially for combat-style boots intended for extended wear. Remember that leather boots stretch over time while synthetic materials maintain their original dimensions.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"my-experience-testing\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #d63384; font-size: 2em; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #d63384; padding-bottom: 10px;\">My Experience Testing Different Punk Boot Brands</h2>\n<p>Over the past 15 years, I've personally worn and tested over 20 different pairs of punk boots, from $15 thrift store military surplus to $400 handcrafted premium boots. This hands-on experience has taught me which brands deliver on their promises and which rely primarily on marketing hype. Here's my honest assessment based on real-world testing in the harshest conditions punk boots face: daily wear, concert environments, and outdoor adventures.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #495057; font-size: 1.5em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">The Great Military Surplus Experiment</h3>\n<p>My first serious punk boots were Vietnam-era Corcoran combat boots purchased for $20 at a military surplus store in 2009. These boots served as my daily footwear for three years, surviving over 50 concerts, multiple cross-country road trips, and countless hours of urban exploration. The steel toes protected my feet from stage diving incidents and dropped equipment, while the durable leather developed rich patina that told stories of adventures.</p>\n<p>What surprised me most was their comfort level. Despite lacking modern cushioning technology, the simple construction and quality leather broke in beautifully after the initial two-week adjustment period. The lug soles provided excellent traction in all weather conditions, from muddy festival grounds to icy winter streets. When they finally wore out after three years of intensive use, the failure point was sole separation rather than upper leather deterioration—testament to the quality of military construction standards.</p>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTSv8Pqc6gM\" style=\"border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<h3 style=\"color: #495057; font-size: 1.5em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">The Doc Martens Disappointment</h3>\n<p>Eager to experience the legendary Dr. Martens quality, I purchased a pair of modern 1460s in 2012 for $150. The initial impression was positive—classic styling, comfortable air-cushioned soles, and the iconic yellow stitching that defines the brand. However, reality set in after six months of regular wear. The leather began cracking around high-flex areas, particularly where the upper meets the sole. The famous \"bouncing\" sole lost its responsiveness, becoming flat and lifeless.</p>\n<p>Most frustratingly, the sole began separating from the upper after eight months—a problem that never occurred with my military surplus boots despite three years of harder use. This experience taught me the importance of distinguishing between heritage brands trading on past reputation versus current manufacturing quality. The contrast between vintage Doc Martens found at thrift stores and modern production became starkly apparent.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #fff3cd; border: 1px solid #ffeaa7; border-radius: 8px; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0; font-style: italic;\"><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> Brand recognition doesn't guarantee quality. Always research current manufacturing practices and read recent reviews from actual users rather than relying on historical reputation or marketing claims.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 style=\"color: #495057; font-size: 1.5em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">The Demonia Platform Adventure</h3>\n<p>Curiosity about platform punk boots led me to purchase Demonia STACK-201s with 7-inch platform soles in 2015. These boots transformed my appearance dramatically—adding significant height and creating an imposing silhouette that commanded attention at shows and gatherings. The initial learning curve was steep, requiring careful attention to balance and gait modification, but the confidence boost was undeniable.</p>\n<p>However, practical limitations became apparent quickly. Walking long distances was uncomfortable, stairs required careful navigation, and dancing at shows became challenging rather than liberating. The boots served their purpose as statement pieces for special occasions but couldn't replace traditional combat boots for daily wear. Quality-wise, they held up better than expected over two years of occasional use, though the extreme height made them unsuitable for many activities.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #495057; font-size: 1.5em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">The Solovair Revelation</h3>\n<p>After hearing recommendations from fellow punks, I invested in Solovair 1460s in 2018—essentially buying what Doc Martens should have been. The $280 price tag was painful initially, but the quality became apparent immediately. The leather was noticeably thicker and more supple than modern Doc Martens, the construction felt solid throughout, and the attention to detail was evident in every element from stitching to hardware.</p>\n<p>Three years later, these boots continue to improve with age. The leather has developed gorgeous patina while maintaining structural integrity, the soles show minimal wear despite regular use, and comfort has actually improved as they've molded to my feet. This experience convinced me that investing in quality boots saves money long-term while providing superior performance and satisfaction.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"pros-cons-popular\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #d63384; font-size: 2em; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #d63384; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Pros and Cons of Popular Punk Boot Options</h2>\n<p>Understanding the advantages and limitations of different punk boot categories helps you make informed decisions based on your priorities, budget, and intended use.

Key elements include combat-style design, buckles, studs, or chains. Choose based on your personal style preference, comfort needs, and intended use - whether for concerts, daily wear, or fashion statements. Combat boots work best for versatility and daily wear, while platform boots make dramatic fashion statements. Consider your lifestyle, budget, and ethical preferences when selecting between traditional leather and vegan options.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #495057; font-size: 1.3em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #dee2e6; padding-bottom: 5px;\">Are Doc Martens still the best choice for punk boots in 2024?</h3>\n<p>While Doc Martens remain iconic, their quality has declined since moving production offshore. Made-in-England Doc Martens are superior but expensive. Consider alternatives like Solovair (made in original Doc Martens factories), Gripfast for premium ranger boots, or military surplus for budget-friendly options. Modern Doc Martens work for casual wear but may not match the durability of vintage pairs or specialized punk boot brands. Many punk enthusiasts now prefer alternatives that offer better value and quality for the price point, especially Solovair for those seeking authentic British craftsmanship.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #495057; font-size: 1.3em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #dee2e6; padding-bottom: 5px;\">What's the difference between combat boots and punk boots?</h3>\n<p>Combat boots are military-inspired functional footwear designed for durability and protection. Punk boots evolved from combat boots but emphasize style and subcultural identity alongside functionality. Punk boots often feature more aggressive aesthetics - extra buckles, studs, chains, or platform soles. While combat boots prioritize practical use, punk boots balance functionality with rebellious fashion statements and subcultural symbolism. Traditional combat boots typically feature 8-12 eyelets and steel toes, while punk variations may include 20+ eyelets, elaborate hardware, or extreme platform soles depending on the specific subgenre and personal preferences of the wearer.</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section id=\"conclusion\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n<h2 style=\"color: #d63384; font-size: 2em; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #d63384; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Conclusion</h2>\n<img alt=\"Modern punk boots collection showing evolution from military surplus to contemporary alternative footwear\" src=\"https://anyasreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Wear-This-not-that-fall-fashion-but-make-it-barefoot-combat-boots-2024.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 500px; height: 300px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px; float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\">\n<p>The world of punk boots offers incredible diversity, from authentic military surplus gems to cutting-edge alternative fashion statements. After 15+ years of testing, wearing, and living in various punk boot styles, I can confidently say that the perfect pair depends entirely on your individual needs, aesthetic preferences, and commitment to punk culture values.</p>\n<p>Military surplus remains the gold standard for authenticity, durability, and punk credibility. Brands like Corcoran offer unmatched value and genuine subcultural heritage that resonates with punk's DIY ethos. For those seeking modern craftsmanship without compromising quality, Solovair represents the pinnacle of traditional punk boot construction, while brands like <i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/steel-boots\" style=\"color: #d63384;\">Steel Boots</a></i> provide affordable alternatives with extensive customization options.</p>\n<p>The decline of Doc Martens quality serves as a reminder that brand recognition doesn't guarantee current performance. While vintage Doc Martens remain exceptional, modern alternatives often provide superior value and quality. Platform boots from companies like Demonia serve specific aesthetic purposes but require realistic expectations about practical limitations.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;\">\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D47BQKH2?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #28a745, #20c997); color: white; padding: 15px 30px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 25px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 1px; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(40, 167, 69, 0.4); transition: all 0.3s ease;\">Complete Your Punk Look Today</a>\n</div>\n<p>The punk boot landscape continues evolving with new brands, materials, and styles emerging regularly. Vegan alternatives have dramatically improved in quality, offering ethical options without compromising performance. Online retailers have democratized access to previously hard-to-find brands, though this abundance requires more careful research to distinguish quality from marketing hype.</p>\n<p>My personal recommendation prioritizes buying the best quality boots you can afford, as they're investment pieces that improve with age while serving as daily armor for navigating both literal and metaphorical battlefields. Whether you choose $20 surplus boots or $400 handcrafted masterpieces, ensure they align with your values, lifestyle, and aesthetic goals.</p>\n<p>The punk spirit lives in authentic self-expression rather than brand conformity. Some of my most memorable boot experiences came from unexpected sources - thrift store finds, hand-me-downs from scene veterans, or modified surplus boots personalized through DIY customization. The best punk boots tell your unique story while connecting you to the broader legacy of punk culture and rebellion.</p>\n<p>For those just starting their punk boot journey, I recommend beginning with military surplus or entry-level combat boots from established brands. This allows you to understand your preferences without major financial commitment. As your involvement in punk culture deepens, you can invest in premium boots that will serve as faithful companions for decades of adventures, shows, and self-expression.</p>\n<p>Remember that punk boots represent more than footwear - they're symbols of nonconformity, tools of rebellion, and badges of belonging to a community that values authenticity over acceptance. Choose boots that make you feel powerful, confident, and ready to face whatever challenges come your way. The punk spirit demands nothing less than footwear that matches your rebellious soul.</p>\n</section>\n</main>\n\n<script crossorigin=\"anonymous\" data-cf-beacon=\"{&quot;rayId&quot;:&quot;96c6a94b893e5fb3&quot;,&quot;serverTiming&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:{&quot;cfExtPri&quot;:true,&quot;cfEdge&quot;:true,&quot;cfOrigin&quot;:true,&quot;cfL4&quot;:true,&quot;cfSpeedBrain&quot;:true,&quot;cfCacheStatus&quot;:true}},&quot;version&quot;:&quot;2025.7.0&quot;,&quot;token&quot;:&quot;4edd5f8ec12a48cfa682ab8261b80a79&quot;}\" defer=\"\" integrity=\"sha512-ZpsOmlRQV6y907TI0dKBHq9Md29nnaEIPlkf84rnaERnq6zvWvPUqr2ft8M1aS28oN72PdrCzSjY4U6VaAw1EQ==\" src=\"https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js/vcd15cbe7772f49c399c6a5babf22c1241717689176015\"></script>\n\n\n\n"
