Unlike Patagonia's Worn Wear initiative that focuses specifically on their brand, REI's program accepts and resells used gear from virtually any outdoor brand, making it one of the most comprehensive used gear programs in the industry.</p>\n                \n                <p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;\">The program operates on a simple yet effective model: REI Co-op members can trade in their gently used outdoor gear and apparel for store credit, which REI then inspects, prices, and resells to other members at significantly discounted prices. This creates a circular economy that benefits everyone involved while reducing environmental impact.</p>\n                \n                <p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;\">What sets REI worn wear apart from other resale platforms is the company's rigorous inspection process and satisfaction guarantee. Every item goes through multiple quality checks before being offered for sale, and members can shop with confidence knowing they're getting functional, tested equipment. The program has evolved from the traditional \"garage sale\" events to year-round availability both online and in select stores.</p>\n                \n                <div style=\"background: #fef3c7; border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 25px 0;\">\n                    <p style=\"margin: 0; font-weight: 500;\"><i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb\" style=\"color: #f59e0b; margin-right: 8px;\"></i><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The REI worn wear program saves members an average of 30-70% compared to buying new, while the trade-in component typically offers 10-30% of original retail value for quality used gear.</p>\n                </div>\n                \n                <p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;\">The sustainability aspect cannot be overstated. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 85% of clothing ends up in landfills or gets incinerated annually. REI's worn wear initiative directly addresses this issue by extending the lifecycle of outdoor gear and reducing waste.

I discovered a Gregory Baltoro 75 backpack marked as \"moderately worn\" for $180. Upon inspection, I realized the \"wear\" consisted of some dust and a few scuff marks that cleaned off completely. The pack's original tags were still attached to several unused features. This taught me that REI's condition descriptions tend to be conservative, often working in the buyer's favor.</p>\n                \n                <p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;\">The trade-in process has been equally rewarding. When I upgraded my <i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/hiking-wear\" style=\"color: #059669; text-decoration: none;\">hiking wear</a></i> collection, I traded in my old Arc'teryx rain jacket, some barely-worn Smartwool base layers, and a pair of Darn Tough socks. The total trade-in value was $238, which I immediately applied toward a new tent during REI's anniversary sale. The ranger at Mount Rainier National Park later commented on seeing that same Arc'teryx jacket for sale, noting how well-maintained it looked.</p>\n                \n                <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ep94nDQQeQ\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"REI Re/Supply trade-in process demonstration\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 400px; border: none; border-radius: 12px; margin: 25px 0; box-shadow: 0 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\"></iframe>\n                \n                <p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;\">The seasonal timing strategy I've developed involves shopping for <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/winter-outdoor-wear\" style=\"color: #059669; text-decoration: none;\">winter outdoor wear</a></b> in spring and summer gear during fall.

Unlike platforms where you set your own prices, REI's staff determines trade-in values based on brand recognition, condition, current demand, and retail pricing.

Items from Arc'teryx, Patagonia, REI Co-op, and Osprey typically offer the best return on investment when trading in. A three-year-old Patagonia jacket in good condition might receive 25-30% of its original value, while a comparable no-name brand might only fetch 10-15%.</p>\n                \n                <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: bold; color: #374151; margin: 30px 0 20px 0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-dollar-sign\" style=\"color: #10b981; margin-right: 10px;\"></i>Preparation Strategies for Maximum Value</h3>\n                \n                <p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;\">Cleaning and minor repairs significantly impact trade-in valuations.

Members trade in gently used gear for store credit, and these items are then sold at discounted prices to other members. The program promotes sustainability while making outdoor gear more affordable. Items undergo rigorous inspection before being offered for sale, ensuring quality and functionality.

Used gear purchased online must be returned via mail within 30 days of purchase. However, used gear purchased in-store is typically final sale, though you can inspect and test items before buying.

Generally, you can expect 10-30% of the original retail price for items in good condition. High-demand brands like Patagonia, Arc'teryx, and REI Co-op tend to have better trade-in values. Premium items in excellent condition may reach 30-40% of retail value, while lesser-known brands or heavily worn items might only fetch 10-15%.

Items should be clean, free from major damage, and have all essential components. They don't accept safety equipment like helmets or harnesses due to liability concerns. Each item is inspected by REI staff to determine if it meets program requirements. Minor cosmetic wear is acceptable, but items with broken zippers, large tears, permanent stains, or missing parts will likely be rejected.

The Clackamas, Oregon location is a dedicated Re/Supply store offering the largest in-person selection. Most regular REI locations have a used gear section, though selection varies by store size and local trade-in volume.

You can save 30-70% off retail prices while getting quality gear that performs well for many years. However, carefully inspect items for wear, functionality, and remaining useful life. Used gear works best for budget-conscious buyers, people trying new activities, or those wanting access to premium brands. Consider new gear for safety-critical items, perfect-fit requirements, or when you need the latest features and full warranty coverage.

Through twelve years of personal experience with the program, I've witnessed its evolution from occasional garage sales to a comprehensive year-round platform that makes quality outdoor equipment accessible to more people.</p>\n                \n                <p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;\">The program's success lies in its balance of value, quality assurance, and environmental responsibility. By extending the lifecycle of outdoor gear, REI worn wear keeps functional equipment in use while reducing the environmental impact of manufacturing new items. For participants, this translates to significant savings on premium gear and opportunities to try expensive equipment without full financial commitment.</p>\n                \n                <p style=\"font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;\">Success in the used gear market requires patience, knowledge, and strategic thinking. Understanding brand values, seasonal patterns, and condition assessment skills dramatically improves your outcomes.
