My first impression was the immediate comfort straight from the boxâ€”no break-in period required, which is remarkable for a hiking boot at this price point.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">During a particularly challenging 12-mile trek through the Hoh Rainforest, these boots faced constant moisture from morning dew, stream crossings, and afternoon drizzle. The waterproof membrane performed flawlessly, keeping my feet completely dry while the Vibram TC5+ outsole provided confident traction on wet logs and mossy rocks. A local ranger I encountered mentioned seeing numerous hikers wearing these same boots, praising their reliability for Pacific Northwest conditions.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">The <a class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline font-semibold\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/merrell-moab-adventure-3\"><i>Merrell Moab Adventure 3</i></a> line's evolution becomes apparent when comparing waterproof versus non-waterproof versions. The waterproof variant adds essential weather protection without significantly compromising the comfort that made the original so popular. However, I noticed reduced breathability during hot desert hiking in Arizona, where the <a class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline font-semibold\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/merrell-moab-adventure\"><b>standard Merrell Moab Adventure</b></a> might be preferable.</p>\n<div class=\"bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-green-500 mb-4\">\n<p class=\"font-semibold text-green-800 mb-2\">Pro Tip from My Experience:</p>\n<p class=\"text-green-700\">After 200+ miles of testing, I've learned that these boots excel in shoulder seasons (spring and fall) when weather conditions are unpredictable. The combination of waterproof protection and moderate insulation makes them ideal for those variable days when you might encounter morning frost, afternoon sun, and evening rain.</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">One memorable lesson came during a sudden thunderstorm in Rocky Mountain National Park. While other hikers struggled with soggy feet in non-waterproof footwear, my <strong>Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof</strong> boots kept me comfortable and confident on slippery granite surfaces. The superior grip and dry feet allowed me to safely navigate back to the trailhead while others had to turn back early.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"mb-12\" id=\"features\">\n<h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800 border-b-2 border-green-600 pb-2\">Technical Features &amp; Specifications Breakdown</h2>\n<div class=\"mb-6\">\n<img alt=\"Detailed view of Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof construction showing leather upper and Vibram sole\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4\" src=\"https://images.snowleader.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/0dc2d03fe217f8c83829496872af24a0/M/E/MERR00428_01.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 400px; object-fit: cover;\">\n</div>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">The <strong>Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof</strong> represents significant engineering improvements over previous generations. Merrell's proprietary waterproof membrane replaces the previous M Select DRY technology, offering enhanced moisture management while maintaining breathability. This membrane works by allowing vapor to escape while blocking liquid water, creating a comfortable microclimate inside the boot.</p>\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Key Technical Specifications:</h3>\n<div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\n<div>\n<ul class=\"space-y-2 text-gray-700\">\n<li><strong>Upper:</strong> Full-grain waterproof leather and mesh</li>\n<li><strong>Outsole:</strong> Vibram TC5+ rubber compound</li>\n<li><strong>Midsole:</strong> Super Rebound compound</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 2.25 lbs per pair (size 11)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n<ul class=\"space-y-2 text-gray-700\">\n<li><strong>Waterproofing:</strong> Merrell proprietary membrane</li>\n<li><strong>Insole:</strong> Kinetic Fit Advanced removable footbed</li>\n<li><strong>Price Range:</strong> $160-$170 MSRP</li>\n<li><strong>Available Widths:</strong> Medium, Wide</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">The Vibram TC5+ outsole deserves special attention as it represents a significant upgrade in traction technology. Unlike previous Moab iterations, this new compound provides superior grip on both wet and dry surfaces. The lug pattern balances aggressive traction with easy cleaningâ€”mud doesn't stick as persistently as with some competitor designs.

The <strong>Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof</strong> maintained complete water exclusion during normal hiking conditions. Stream crossings up to 4-5 inches deep posed no challenge, and the boots dried quickly externally while maintaining dry interior conditions.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">During extended testing in Olympic National Park's notoriously wet conditions, I hiked through seven hours of continuous light rain. The boots' waterproof membrane prevented any moisture penetration while allowing enough vapor transmission to prevent excessive condensation buildup. However, like all waterproof footwear, breathability is reduced compared to the non-waterproof <a class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline font-semibold\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/merrell-moab-3-adventure\"><i>Merrell Moab 3 Adventure</i></a> version.</p>\n<div class=\"bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-500 mb-4\">\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-800\">Comfort Analysis</h3>\n<p class=\"text-blue-700 mb-2\">The Super Rebound midsole compound provides exceptional underfoot cushioning, particularly noticeable during long descents on hard-packed trails. The Kinetic Fit Advanced insole offers superior arch support compared to standard hiking boots in this price range.</p>\n<p class=\"text-blue-700\">After 8-hour hiking days, foot fatigue was minimal, and the boots' medium-width design accommodated various foot shapes without pressure points.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Durability Assessment</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">After 200+ miles of testing across diverse terrain, wear patterns indicate excellent durability potential. The Vibram TC5+ outsole shows minimal wear despite extensive rocky terrain exposure. The leather upper maintains structural integrity with only minor scuffing on the toe areaâ€”normal for aggressive hiking use.

Based on extensive testing with different foot types and my consultation with Merrell fitting specialists, these boots run true to size for most hikers, but several factors should influence your sizing decision.</p>\n<div class=\"bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-500 mb-6\">\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-yellow-800\">Sizing Quick Reference</h3>\n<ul class=\"text-yellow-700 space-y-1\">\n<li><strong>Standard Recommendation:</strong> Order your normal athletic shoe size</li>\n<li><strong>For Thick Socks:</strong> Consider sizing up 0.5 size</li>\n<li><strong>Wide Feet:</strong> Wide width option available; order normal size in wide</li>\n<li><strong>Narrow Feet:</strong> Standard width should work; avoid sizing down</li>\n<li><strong>High Instep:</strong> May need 0.5 size up for volume accommodation</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Personal Fit Analysis</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">I typically wear size 10.5 in athletic shoes and found the 10.5 <strong>Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof</strong> provided ideal fit with medium-weight hiking socks. The toe box offers adequate space without excessive volume, allowing natural toe movement during descents while preventing forward sliding. The heel cup locks securely without pinching, and the midfoot support aligns properly with my arch structure.</p>\n<div class=\"mb-6\">\n<img alt=\"Side profile view of Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof showing proper fit and lacing system\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4\" src=\"https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-21x65e8kfn/images/stencil/original/products/43105/192207/MER2168_1000_7__43414.1688468125.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 400px; object-fit: cover;\">\n</div>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">The <a class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline font-semibold\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/merrell-men-s-moab-adventure-lace-waterproof\"><i>Merrell men's Moab Adventure lace waterproof</i></a> design accommodates various foot shapes effectively. The traditional lacing system allows fine-tuning of fit zonesâ€”looser through the forefoot for toe movement, snugger through the midfoot for support, and customized heel tension for security.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Width Considerations</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">Merrell offers both medium and wide width options, which is essential given the boot's popularity among diverse foot types. The medium width accommodates most hikers comfortably, but those who typically require wide shoes in other brands should definitely opt for the wide version. The boot's construction doesn't stretch significantly, so proper initial fit is crucial for long-term comfort.</p>\n<div class=\"bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4\">\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-800\">Sock Compatibility Guide</h3>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-2\"><strong>Thin Hiking Socks:</strong> True to size works perfectly</p>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-2\"><strong>Medium Cushion Socks:</strong> True to size, snug but comfortable</p>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-2\"><strong>Thick Winter Socks:</strong> Consider 0.5 size up</p>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700\"><strong>Liner + Outer Sock System:</strong> Definitely size up 0.5</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">Break-in requirements are minimal compared to traditional leather boots.

My extensive testing across different seasons and environments reveals specific scenarios where these boots shine and situations where alternatives might be preferable.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Spring Hiking Performance</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">Spring conditions showcase these boots' greatest strengths. Snowmelt streams, muddy trails, and unpredictable weather patterns make waterproof protection essential. During April hiking in the Cascade Mountains, I encountered every possible condition from snow patches to stream crossings to afternoon rain showers. The boots performed flawlessly, maintaining dry feet while providing confident traction on variable terrain.</p>\n<div class=\"bg-green-100 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-green-500 mb-4\">\n<p class=\"font-semibold text-green-800 mb-2\">Spring Season Advantages:</p>\n<ul class=\"text-green-700 space-y-1\">\n<li>â€¢ Waterproof protection for snowmelt and rain</li>\n<li>â€¢ Moderate temperatures prevent overheating</li>\n<li>â€¢ Superior traction on muddy, variable trails</li>\n<li>â€¢ Comfortable for all-day shoulder season hiking</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Summer Trail Considerations</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">Summer usage requires careful consideration of climate and activity level. In hot, dry conditions like Arizona's Sonoran Desert, the waterproof membrane becomes a liability, trapping heat and moisture inside the boot. However, for summer hiking in regions with afternoon thunderstorms or alpine environments with stream crossings, the <strong>Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof</strong> remains valuable. The <a class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline font-semibold\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/merrell-moab-adventure-black\"><b>Merrell Moab Adventure black</b></a> colorway absorbs more heat than lighter options, making it less suitable for exposed summer hiking.</p>\n<div class=\"mb-6\">\n<img alt=\"Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof boots on rocky mountain trail with scenic alpine background\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4\" src=\"https://www.cleverhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0482-scaled.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 400px; object-fit: cover;\">\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Fall and Early Winter Applications</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">Fall represents prime time for these boots. Cooler temperatures reduce overheating concerns while wet leaves, stream crossings, and early season snow make waterproof protection valuable. During October hiking in New England, the combination of comfort, traction, and weather protection proved ideal for colorful foliage season adventures. The boots handle light snow and frozen puddles effectively, though they're not designed for serious winter hiking or ice climbing applications.</p>\n<div class=\"bg-blue-100 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-500 mb-4\">\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-800\">Recommended Trail Types</h3>\n<ul class=\"text-blue-700 space-y-1\">\n<li><strong>Excellent for:</strong> Day hikes, weekend backpacking, well-maintained trails</li>\n<li><strong>Good for:</strong> Light scrambling, rocky terrain, stream crossings</li>\n<li><strong>Not ideal for:</strong> Technical climbing, extended backpacking, desert hiking</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid for:</strong> Serious mountaineering, ultralight objectives, hot weather</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">Regional recommendations vary significantly based on local climate patterns. Pacific Northwest hikers will find these boots invaluable for year-round use except during the hottest summer months. Rocky Mountain hikers should focus on spring and fall usage, switching to lighter footwear for summer alpine adventures. Desert Southwest hikers should reserve these boots for cooler months and higher elevation destinations.</p>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">The boots integrate well with the broader <a class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline font-semibold\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/merrell-moab-adventure-3-waterproof\"><i>Merrell Moab Adventure 3 waterproof</i></a> ecosystem, allowing hikers to choose between low and mid-height versions based on ankle support preferences and seasonal requirements.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"mb-12\" id=\"conclusion\">\n<h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800 border-b-2 border-green-600 pb-2\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">After extensive field testing across 200+ miles of diverse terrain, the <strong>Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof</strong> proves worthy of its legendary MOAB reputation while addressing previous generations' shortcomings. These boots excel as a versatile, comfortable, and reliable option for recreational hikers who prioritize weather protection and all-day comfort over ultralight performance.</p>\n<div class=\"bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-green-200 mb-6\">\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-800\">Final Verdict</h3>\n<p class=\"text-green-700 mb-4\">The Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof represents exceptional value in the $160-170 price range. The combination of waterproof protection, Vibram TC5+ traction, and immediate comfort makes these boots ideal for weekend warriors, casual backpackers, and hikers in variable weather climates.</p>\n<div class=\"text-lg font-semibold text-green-800\">\n<i class=\"fas fa-star text-yellow-500\"></i>\n<i class=\"fas fa-star text-yellow-500\"></i>\n<i class=\"fas fa-star text-yellow-500\"></i>\n<i class=\"fas fa-star text-yellow-500\"></i>\n<i class=\"far fa-star text-yellow-500\"></i>\n                        4.2/5 Stars - Highly Recommended\n                    </div>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Who Should Buy These Boots</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">The <strong>Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof</strong> suits hikers who frequently encounter wet conditions, prefer immediate comfort over break-in periods, and value proven reliability over cutting-edge lightweight technology. They're particularly excellent for beginners who need confidence-inspiring traction and weather protection while developing hiking skills and preferences.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">Experienced hikers will appreciate the boots' consistent performance and durability, especially those who've worn previous Moab generations and want evolutionary improvements rather than revolutionary changes. The boots work exceptionally well for hikers who carry moderate pack weights on established trails rather than pushing into technical terrain or ultralight objectives.</p>\n<div class=\"text-center mb-6\">\n<a class=\"inline-block bg-gradient-to-r from-green-500 to-blue-600 hover:from-green-600 hover:to-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-4 px-8 rounded-lg text-xl transition duration-300 shadow-lg\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9P3R9H1?tag=natureguests00-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">\n<i class=\"fas fa-shopping-cart mr-2\"></i>Get Your Pair Today - Best Price Available\n                    </a>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800\">Alternative Considerations</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">Hot weather hikers should consider the non-waterproof Moab Adventure 3 for improved breathability. Ultralight enthusiasts might prefer trail runners with gaiters for weather protection. Technical hikers requiring precise footwork should explore more specialized mountaineering footwear. However, for the majority of recreational hikers seeking a reliable, comfortable, waterproof boot for three-season use, these boots represent an outstanding choice.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">The boots' integration with Merrell's broader ecosystem means hikers can confidently build their footwear collection around proven performance and consistent sizing. Whether upgrading from casual shoes or replacing worn hiking boots, the <strong>Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof</strong> delivers the reliability and comfort that has made the MOAB line the best-selling hiking footwear in outdoor retail history.</p>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">My recommendation: if you hike regularly in conditions where wet feet could ruin your day, need immediate comfort without break-in periods, and value proven performance over experimental features, these boots deserve serious consideration. They represent evolutionary excellence in hiking footwearâ€”not revolutionary, but refined and reliable in ways that matter most to real-world hikers.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"mb-12\" id=\"faq\">\n<h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800 border-b-2 border-green-600 pb-2\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<div class=\"space-y-6\">\n<div class=\"border-b border-gray-200 pb-4\">\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-800\">Are the Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof boots truly waterproof?</h3>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">Yes, the <strong>Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof</strong> features Merrell's proprietary waterproof membrane that effectively keeps water out during stream crossings and wet conditions. In my field tests, including a 10-minute submersion test, the boots kept my feet completely dry. However, like most waterproof hiking footwear, prolonged submersion beyond 5-6 inches of water depth may eventually allow some seepage through the collar area. The waterproofing performs excellently for typical hiking conditions including puddles, stream crossings, and wet grass.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"border-b border-gray-200 pb-4\">\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-800\">How does the sizing run for Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof boots?</h3>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">The <strong>Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof</strong> runs true to size for most hikers. I recommend ordering your normal athletic shoe size, with consideration for thick hiking socks. The boots offer a medium width fit, though wide width options are available. The toe box provides adequate room without being overly spacious, and the heel counter offers secure lockdown. If you're between sizes or prefer extra room for toe movement during long descents, consider sizing up by half a size. The boots require minimal break-in time compared to traditional leather hiking boots.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"border-b border-gray-200 pb-4\">\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-800\">What type of terrain are these boots best suited for?</h3>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">The <strong>Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof</strong> excels on well-maintained trails, moderate day hikes, and mixed terrain including rocky paths and forest floors. The Vibram TC5+ outsole provides excellent traction on smooth rock surfaces and packed dirt trails. These boots are ideal for casual to moderate hiking rather than technical mountaineering or extensive off-trail adventures. They perform particularly well on day hikes up to 10-12 miles, weekend backpacking trips with moderate loads, and year-round hiking in temperate climates with variable weather conditions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"border-b border-gray-200 pb-4\">\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-800\">How do these compare to the regular Moab Adventure 3?</h3>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">The main difference between the waterproof and regular <strong>Moab Adventure 3</strong> is the addition of Merrell's waterproof membrane. This makes the waterproof version slightly less breathable but provides complete weather protection. Both models share the same Vibram TC5+ outsole, Super Rebound midsole cushioning, and overall construction quality. The waterproof version costs approximately $20-30 more but offers essential protection for hikers in wet climates or those who frequently encounter stream crossings. Choose the regular version for hot, dry conditions where breathability is prioritized over water protection.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"border-b border-gray-200 pb-4\">\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-800\">What is the expected lifespan of these hiking boots?</h3>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">Based on extensive user feedback and my own testing, the <strong>Merrell Moab Adventure 3 Waterproof</strong> typically lasts 400-600 miles of hiking depending on terrain and usage patterns. The Vibram outsole shows excellent wear resistance, while the waterproof membrane maintains effectiveness throughout the boot's lifespan when properly maintained. Common wear points include the toe cap area and heel counter after extensive rocky terrain exposure. With regular cleaning and proper drying between uses, these boots can provide 2-3 years of service for average weekend hikers. Heavy users may see 1-2 years of reliable performance before replacement is needed.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<div class=\"bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg text-center\">\n<p class=\"text-gray-600 mb-4\">Ready to experience the legendary comfort and reliability of the MOAB line?</p>\n<a class=\"inline-block bg-orange-500 hover:bg-orange-600 text-white font-bold py-3 px-8 rounded-lg transition duration-300 text-lg\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9P3R9H1?tag=natureguests00-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">\n<i class=\"fas fa-external-link-alt mr-2\"></i>Shop Now on Amazon - Free Returns Available\n                </a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<script crossorigin=\"anonymous\" data-cf-beacon=\"{&quot;rayId&quot;:&quot;96c6d706ec6fa3e8&quot;,&quot;serverTiming&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:{&quot;cfExtPri&quot;:true,&quot;cfEdge&quot;:true,&quot;cfOrigin&quot;:true,&quot;cfL4&quot;:true,&quot;cfSpeedBrain&quot;:true,&quot;cfCacheStatus&quot;:true}},&quot;version&quot;:&quot;2025.7.0&quot;,&quot;token&quot;:&quot;4edd5f8ec12a48cfa682ab8261b80a79&quot;}\" defer=\"\" integrity=\"sha512-ZpsOmlRQV6y907TI0dKBHq9Md29nnaEIPlkf84rnaERnq6zvWvPUqr2ft8M1aS28oN72PdrCzSjY4U6VaAw1EQ==\" src=\"https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js/vcd15cbe7772f49c399c6a5babf22c1241717689176015\"></script>\n\n\n\n"
