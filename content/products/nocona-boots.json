In an era when female entrepreneurs were extremely rare, Miss Enid's bold decision to establish her own boot company in Nocona, Texas, demonstrated the same pioneering spirit that would later define every pair of boots bearing the Nocona name.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">Enid was the daughter of H.J. \"Daddy Joe\" Justin, who had founded Justin Boots in Spanish Fort, Texas, in 1879. After working in her father's shop for 12 years starting at age 12, Enid developed an intimate understanding of boot-making craftsmanship. When her father passed away in 1918 and the family decided to move the business to Fort Worth, Enid made a courageous stand. She believed so strongly in her father's vision of keeping the company rooted in Nocona that she borrowed $5,000 and retained seven employees to establish what would become the legendary Nocona Boots brand.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #8B4513; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0; font-weight: 600;\">The Oil Field Connection</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">The discovery of oil near Nocona brought unexpected opportunities for the young company. Nocona developed a specialized 16-inch lace-up boot tough enough to withstand the harsh conditions of oil fields, quickly gaining favor among wildcatters who returned repeatedly for these durable, reliable boots. This early specialization in work boots established Nocona's reputation for creating footwear that could handle the most demanding environments.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">Today, Nocona Boots operates as a division of Justin Brands, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's multinational conglomerate. While production moved from the original Nocona factory to El Paso, Texas, in 1999, the brand continues to honor its founder's commitment to quality, authenticity, and the independent spirit that started it all. The company's dedication to handcrafted premium cowboy boots remains unwavering, with collections spanning Fashion, Legacy, Exotic, Western, Rancher, and Competitor categories.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"craftsmanship\" style=\"margin-bottom: 3rem;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-family: 'Merriweather', serif; font-size: 2rem; color: #8B4513; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 2px solid #D2691E; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">\n        Superior Craftsmanship and Quality\n    </h2>\n<img alt=\"Nocona men's Texas tan vintage cow square toe western boots displaying premium leather craftsmanship\" src=\"https://www.broncowesternwear.com/media/catalog/product/cache/e3b09354df14585c4af626aec369a894/m/d/mdut20.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 400px; height: auto; float: left; margin: 0 2rem 1rem 0; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">What sets Nocona boots apart in today's competitive western footwear market is their unwavering commitment to traditional craftsmanship combined with modern innovations. Every pair of Nocona boots represents nearly a century of accumulated knowledge in leather working, boot construction, and western styling. The company's dedication to quality begins with the selection of premium materials, including high-grade leathers sourced from trusted suppliers who share their commitment to excellence.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">The construction process involves meticulous attention to detail at every stage. From the initial cutting of leather patterns to the final stitching and finishing, skilled craftsmen ensure that each boot meets the exacting standards established by Enid Justin nearly 100 years ago. The traditional Goodyear welt construction used in many <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/engineer-boots\" style=\"color: #8B4513; text-decoration: none;\">engineer boots</a></b> and premium western styles provides exceptional durability and the ability to resole the boots multiple times, extending their lifespan significantly.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #8B4513; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0; font-weight: 600;\">Material Selection and Leather Quality</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">Nocona's material selection process reflects their commitment to quality over cost-cutting. The company sources full-grain leather, the highest quality leather available, which retains the complete grain structure and natural characteristics of the hide. This results in boots that not only look exceptional but also develop a unique patina over time, becoming more beautiful and personalized with wear. The exotic leather collections feature premium materials like <i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/ostrich-boots\" style=\"color: #8B4513; text-decoration: none;\">ostrich boots</a></i>, <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/python-boots\" style=\"color: #8B4513; text-decoration: none;\">python boots</a></b>, and <i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/stingray-boots\" style=\"color: #8B4513; text-decoration: none;\">stingray boots</a></i>, each carefully selected for its unique texture, durability, and aesthetic appeal.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">The comfort technology integrated into modern Nocona boots represents a perfect marriage of traditional craftsmanship and contemporary innovation. Features like cushioned insoles, moisture-wicking linings, and ergonomically designed footbeds ensure that these boots can be worn comfortably for extended periods, whether you're working on a ranch, attending a rodeo, or exploring the great outdoors.</p>\n</section>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0; padding: 2rem; background-color: #8B4513; border-radius: 12px;\">\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3Uk0-XI3eQ\" style=\"border-radius: 8px; max-width: 800px;\" title=\"Nocona Boots Review - Vintage Western Cowboy Boots\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<p style=\"color: #FFE4B5; margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic;\">Expert review of vintage Nocona boots showcasing their timeless appeal and quality construction</p>\n</div>\n<section id=\"collections\" style=\"margin-bottom: 3rem;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-family: 'Merriweather', serif; font-size: 2rem; color: #8B4513; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 2px solid #D2691E; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">\n        Exploring Nocona Collections\n    </h2>\n<img alt=\"Nocona ladies exotic western boot with black full quill ostrich foot and wide square toe\" src=\"https://www.quality-western-boots.com/boots/pc/catalog/Nocona_NBC_LD8501_Detail.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 350px; height: auto; float: right; margin: 0 0 1rem 2rem; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">Nocona's diverse collection offerings cater to every western lifestyle and personal preference, from traditional ranch work to urban western fashion.

A fellow park ranger recommended Nocona boots after noticing my struggle with inferior footwear that couldn't handle the diverse terrain and changing weather conditions. That recommendation led to my first pair of Nocona Legacy boots, and I haven't looked back since.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">What immediately impressed me was the attention to detail in the construction. Unlike some modern boots that prioritize speed of production over quality, my Nocona boots showed clear evidence of careful handcraftsmanship. The stitching was perfectly uniform, the leather selection was exceptional, and the fit was remarkably comfortable right out of the box. During my first extended wear test – a three-day camping trip in the Chihuahuan Desert – these boots performed flawlessly across rocky terrain, sandy washes, and everything in between.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #8B4513; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0; font-weight: 600;\">Breaking In and Long-Term Comfort</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">One of the most significant advantages I discovered with Nocona boots was the minimal break-in period required. While many premium western boots, including some <i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/redwings-boots\" style=\"color: #8B4513; text-decoration: none;\">Red Wings boots</a></i> I've owned, required weeks of gradual wear to become comfortable, my Nocona boots felt great after just a few days of regular wear. The leather was supple enough to accommodate my foot shape while maintaining the structural integrity necessary for long-term durability.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">After three years of regular use in some of the most challenging environments our national parks offer, from the rocky trails of Joshua Tree to the muddy paths of Great Smoky Mountains, my original Nocona boots continue to perform exceptionally well. The leather has developed a beautiful patina that tells the story of our adventures together, while the sole shows minimal wear despite thousands of miles of hiking and outdoor exploration.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #8B4513; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0; font-weight: 600;\">Seasonal Performance and Versatility</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">Living in Texas and working extensively throughout the Southwest, I've put my Nocona boots through extreme seasonal variations. During summer months with temperatures exceeding 100°F, the breathable leather construction and moisture-wicking linings kept my feet comfortable even during extended periods of activity. The winter months proved equally impressive, with the boots providing excellent insulation and maintaining flexibility in freezing temperatures. This versatility makes them far superior to specialized seasonal footwear like <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/snowmobile-boots\" style=\"color: #8B4513; text-decoration: none;\">snowmobile boots</a></b> that excel in one condition but fail in others.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"buying-guide\" style=\"margin-bottom: 3rem;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-family: 'Merriweather', serif; font-size: 2rem; color: #8B4513; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 2px solid #D2691E; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">\n        Complete Buying Guide\n    </h2>\n<img alt=\"Nocona MD2701 men's legacy western boot with tan vintage cow foot and medium round toe\" src=\"https://www.quality-western-boots.com/boots/pc/catalog/Nocona_NBC_MD2701_Detail.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 350px; height: auto; float: right; margin: 0 0 1rem 2rem; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">Selecting the perfect pair of Nocona boots requires understanding several key factors that influence both performance and satisfaction. Unlike purchasing casual footwear, investing in premium western boots like Nocona requires careful consideration of intended use, fit preferences, style requirements, and long-term maintenance expectations. This comprehensive buying guide draws from extensive field testing and customer feedback to help you make an informed decision.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #8B4513; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0; font-weight: 600;\">Sizing and Fit Considerations</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">Proper sizing is crucial for western boots, as the fit directly impacts both comfort and performance. Nocona boots typically run true to size, but western boot sizing differs from athletic shoe sizing. Your Nocona boots should fit snugly through the heel and arch with minimal heel slippage, while allowing enough room in the toe box for natural foot expansion during extended wear. Unlike some European brands like <i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/acne-boots\" style=\"color: #8B4513; text-decoration: none;\">Acne boots</a></i> that may require size adjustments, Nocona maintains consistent sizing across their collections.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">Consider the sock thickness you'll typically wear with your boots, as this affects fit significantly. For outdoor activities and extended wear, medium-weight merino wool socks provide the best combination of cushioning, moisture management, and temperature regulation. If you plan to wear your Nocona boots primarily for fashion purposes, thinner dress socks may be more appropriate.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #8B4513; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0; font-weight: 600;\">Choosing the Right Collection</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">Different Nocona collections serve different purposes and lifestyles. The Legacy collection offers the best balance of traditional styling and modern comfort for general use. The Hero collection provides bold styling for those who want to make a statement, while the Miss Enid collection honors classic western aesthetics with contemporary enhancements. For those seeking luxury options, the exotic collections featuring materials similar to <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/pirarucu-boots\" style=\"color: #8B4513; text-decoration: none;\">pirarucu boots</a></b> offer unique textures and premium construction.</p>\n<div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr)); gap: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center; padding: 1rem; background-color: white; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\">\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G5I1T5Q?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #8B4513;\">\n<h4 style=\"font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Nocona Belt Buckle</h4>\n<p style=\"font-size: 0.9rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Silver Bison Scaloped Design</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #D2691E;\">$22.00</p>\n<button style=\"background-color: #FF9500; color: white; padding: 0.5rem 1rem; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;\">Amazon's Choice</button>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; padding: 1rem; background-color: white; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\">\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079RRYLLD?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #8B4513;\">\n<h4 style=\"font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Rambler Square Toe Boots</h4>\n<p style=\"font-size: 0.9rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Mid Calf Brown Leather</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #D2691E;\">$189.95</p>\n<button style=\"background-color: #FF9500; color: white; padding: 0.5rem 1rem; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;\">Buy Now</button>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; padding: 1rem; background-color: white; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\">\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000A6XRYU?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #8B4513;\">\n<h4 style=\"font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Heritage Roper Boots</h4>\n<p style=\"font-size: 0.9rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Traditional Leather Country Boot</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #D2691E;\">$169.95</p>\n<button style=\"background-color: #FF9500; color: white; padding: 0.5rem 1rem; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;\">Shop Now</button>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section id=\"reviews\" style=\"margin-bottom: 3rem;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-family: 'Merriweather', serif; font-size: 2rem; color: #8B4513; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 2px solid #D2691E; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">\n        Customer Reviews and Testimonials\n    </h2>\n<img alt=\"Vintage Nocona cowboy boots men's brown bullhide leather western style\" src=\"https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/vNMAAOSwnCpmUKuz/s-l400.png\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 300px; height: auto; float: left; margin: 0 2rem 1rem 0; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">Real customer feedback provides invaluable insights into the long-term performance and satisfaction levels associated with Nocona boots.

The leather quality is exceptional - they've developed a beautiful patina while maintaining their structural integrity through countless hours of riding, fence repair, and general ranch work. The comfort level impressed me from day one, requiring minimal break-in time compared to other western brands I've tried. Even after extended wear in muddy conditions, they clean up beautifully and continue to look great.

Second, the leather quality justifies the investment - I've seen Nocona boots last 8-10 years with regular professional use. The comfort technology has improved significantly in recent years while maintaining the classic aesthetics that define quality western wear. My only criticism is that some of the newer imported models don't match the legendary quality of the original Texas-made boots, but the premium lines still deliver exceptional value.\"</p>\n</div>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #8B4513; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0; font-weight: 600;\">Pros and Cons Analysis</h3>\n<div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 2rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #d4edda; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #28a745;\">\n<h4 style=\"color: #28a745; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><i class=\"fas fa-thumbs-up\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>Strengths</h4>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Exceptional leather quality and craftsmanship</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Minimal break-in period required</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Consistent sizing across collections</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Rich heritage and authentic western styling</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Excellent long-term durability</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Wide variety of collections and styles</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Good resale value for vintage models</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f8d7da; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #dc3545;\">\n<h4 style=\"color: #dc3545; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><i class=\"fas fa-thumbs-down\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>Considerations</h4>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Higher price point than mass-market alternatives</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Some models now made overseas rather than USA</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Limited availability in some regions</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Requires proper care and maintenance</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">May not suit all foot shapes equally</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Break-in period still required for some models</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">The overwhelming consensus among long-term Nocona boot owners is that these boots represent excellent value for money when viewed as a long-term investment rather than a short-term purchase.

However, some premium lines and special collections are still crafted in the United States. When shopping for Nocona boots, look for specific \"Made in USA\" labeling if domestic production is important to you. The quality standards remain high regardless of production location, as Justin Brands maintains strict quality control across all manufacturing facilities.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; color: #8B4513; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-weight: 600;\">How do Nocona boots fit compared to other western boot brands?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 2rem; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;\">Nocona boots generally run true to size and maintain consistent sizing across different collections, which sets them apart from some competitors. The boots are designed with a traditional western fit, meaning they should feel snug through the heel and arch with minimal heel slippage. Compared to brands like Tony Lama or Justin, Nocona boots tend to offer a slightly more generous toe box while maintaining the secure heel fit essential for riding and ranch work. Most customers find their regular boot size works well with Nocona, but trying them on in person is always recommended when possible.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; color: #8B4513; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-weight: 600;\">What is the break-in period for Nocona boots?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 2rem; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;\">One of the advantages of Nocona boots is their relatively short break-in period compared to some premium western boot brands. Most customers report that Nocona boots feel comfortable after 3-5 days of regular wear, with full break-in achieved within 1-2 weeks. This is due to the quality of leather selection and construction methods used. During the break-in period, wear the boots for short periods initially, use quality boot socks, and consider using leather conditioner to help the leather conform to your foot shape more quickly.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; color: #8B4513; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-weight: 600;\">How do I properly care for my Nocona boots?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 2rem; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;\">Proper care significantly extends the life of your Nocona boots and maintains their appearance. Clean your boots regularly with a damp cloth to remove dirt and debris, then allow them to air dry completely before applying leather conditioner. Use a high-quality leather conditioner every 3-6 months or more frequently if you wear the boots in harsh conditions. Store your boots with boot trees to maintain their shape, and rotate between multiple pairs when possible to allow the leather to rest between wears. For exotic leather models, use specialized cleaners designed for that specific material type.</p>\n<h3 :=\"\" be=\"\" boots=\"\" h3=\"\" nocona=\"\" resoled=\"\" style=\"font-size\">\n</h3><p style=\"margin-bottom: 2rem; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;\">Many Nocona boots, particularly those with Goodyear welt construction, can be resoled by qualified boot repair professionals. This construction method allows the sole to be removed and replaced without damaging the upper leather, significantly extending the boot's lifespan. Premium Nocona models typically use this construction, while some entry-level models may use cement construction that makes resoling more difficult or impossible. When purchasing Nocona boots as a long-term investment, consider models with welted construction for the best resoling options and overall durability.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; color: #8B4513; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-weight: 600;\">What makes Nocona boots different from other western boot brands?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;\">Nocona boots distinguish themselves through their rich heritage dating back to 1925, consistent quality across price points, and the pioneering spirit of founder Enid Justin. The brand maintains a perfect balance between traditional western styling and modern comfort technology. Unlike some competitors that focus purely on fashion or work functionality, Nocona offers collections that successfully blend both aspects. Their attention to leather selection, construction details, and sizing consistency has built a loyal following among both working cowboys and western fashion enthusiasts. The brand's connection to authentic western history, combined with modern manufacturing standards, creates boots that honor tradition while meeting contemporary expectations for comfort and durability.</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0; padding: 2rem; background-color: #8B4513; border-radius: 12px;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #FFE4B5; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">Ready to Experience Nocona Quality?</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #FFE4B5; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-size: 1.1rem;\">Discover authentic American craftsmanship with our curated selection of premium western boots</p>\n<a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/nocona-boots\" style=\"display: inline-block; background-color: #FFE4B5; color: #8B4513; padding: 1rem 2rem; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 8px; font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.1rem; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); transition: transform 0.3s;\">\n        Shop Nocona Boots Collection\n    </a>\n</div>\n<section id=\"conclusion\" style=\"margin-bottom: 3rem;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-family: 'Merriweather', serif; font-size: 2rem; color: #8B4513; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 2px solid #D2691E; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">\n        Conclusion\n    </h2>\n<img alt=\"Nocona NB4030 men's imperial calf western boot with black brasilis calf foot and wide square toe\" src=\"https://www.quality-western-boots.com/boots/pc/catalog/Nocona_NBC_NB4030_Detail.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 350px; height: auto; float: right; margin: 0 0 1rem 2rem; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: justify;\">After nearly a century in the western footwear industry, Nocona boots continue to represent the perfect fusion of authentic American heritage and modern craftsmanship innovation.
