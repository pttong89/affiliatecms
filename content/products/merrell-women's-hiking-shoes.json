The dominance of <strong>Merrell women's hiking shoes</strong> in the outdoor market isn't accidentalâ€”it's the result of decades of innovation, rigorous testing, and unwavering commitment to female hikers' specific needs.\n\nThe secret lies in Merrell's understanding that women's feet have distinct characteristics requiring specialized design approaches. Unlike many brands that simply scale down men's designs, Merrell engineers their women's hiking shoes with narrower heels, different arch positioning, and adjusted volume distribution. This attention to anatomical differences explains why so many female hikers, myself included, experience immediate comfort straight out of the box.\n\n<a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-merrell-hiking-shoes-women-s\" style=\"color: #38a169; font-weight: 600;\"><i>The best Merrell hiking shoes for women</i></a> consistently feature Vibram outsoles, which I've found provide exceptional grip on everything from wet granite to loose scree. During my recent autumn hike through the Cascade Range, my Moab 3s gripped confidently on rain-slicked rocks while other hikers in different brands struggled for traction.\n\nThe brand's commitment to sustainability also resonates with environmentally conscious hikers. Many current models incorporate recycled materials without compromising performanceâ€”a balance I deeply appreciate as someone who advocates for protecting the wilderness we love to explore. The durability factor cannot be overstated; my oldest pair has survived over 800 miles of Pacific Northwest trails, including multiple stream crossings and rocky scrambles.\n\nWhat truly sets <strong>Merrell women's hiking shoes</strong> apart is their versatility. Whether you're planning a leisurely day hike through <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/merrell-hiking-shoes-women\" style=\"color: #38a169; font-weight: 600;\"><b>scenic national parks</b></a> or tackling multi-day backpacking adventures, there's a Merrell model engineered for your specific needs. This adaptability, combined with consistent quality and innovative features, explains why seasoned hikers and beginners alike trust Merrell for their trail adventures.\n\n<h2 id=\"top-5-rankings\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2d5016; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #38a169; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Top 5 Merrell Women's Hiking Shoes: Trail-Tested Rankings</h2>\n\n<div style=\"background-color: #f0fff4; padding: 25px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 25px; border: 2px solid #38a169;\">\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2d5016; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-trophy\" style=\"color: #ffd700; margin-right: 8px;\"></i>1.

Finally, the classic Moab 3 (non-waterproof) claims fifth place as the budget-conscious hiker's dream, offering 90% of the premium model's performance at a more accessible price point.\n\nEach ranking considers real-world performance factors including durability, comfort during extended wear, traction on varied surfaces, water resistance, and overall value. These conclusions come from personal testing across diverse environments, from desert Southwest trails to humid Appalachian forests, ensuring recommendations that translate to actual hiking conditions rather than laboratory specifications.\n\n<h2 id=\"my-experience\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2d5016; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #38a169; padding-bottom: 10px;\">My Experience: 1,500+ Miles in Merrell Hiking Shoes</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcT-i91XvYnq19ynnosbP-ONPdHibMR_7GyDLp6WpLR4tGGdN-LfathxhVE2zJihZyu7fx7tyQn4kx2WfMlzBnGwZUZbdURNoDEJC4Bdgjyn3W6yL1LtLJRwIw\" alt=\"Merrell Women's Moab 3 Mid Waterproof boots on rocky mountain trail showing real-world usage\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 300px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n\nMy journey with **Merrell women's hiking shoes** began with skepticism and transformed into unwavering loyalty through countless trail miles across North America's most demanding terrain. Over seven years and fifteen different pairs, I've accumulated insights that only come from real-world testing in conditions ranging from summer heat waves in Arizona's Sonoran Desert to winter snow adventures in Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nThe first revelation came during a challenging 50-mile section of the Pacific Crest Trail in Oregon. My Moab 2 Waterproof models, already six months old with 300+ miles of wear, performed flawlessly through three days of constant drizzle, creek crossings, and muddy switchbacks. While other hikers dealt with soggy socks and blistered feet, my Merrells kept me dry and comfortable, proving their waterproof claims weren't marketing hyperbole but genuine performance features.\n\nSeasonal testing has revealed fascinating insights about different models' performance characteristics. During scorching August hikes through Utah's desert regions, the non-waterproof <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/merrell-hiking-sneakers\" style=\"color: #38a169; font-weight: 600;\"><b>Merrell hiking sneakers</b></a> provided superior breathability, preventing the overheating issues common with waterproof membranes. Conversely, spring snowmelt season in the Cascades demands the full waterproof protection that models like the Moab 3 Mid deliver consistently.\n\nThe learning curve taught me valuable lessons about proper fit and break-in procedures. Initially, I sized my Merrells identically to street shoesâ€”a mistake that resulted in hot spots during longer hikes. After consultation with a knowledgeable REI fitting specialist and advice from veteran hikers, I learned to size up half a size and prioritize proper sock selection. This adjustment transformed my hiking experience, eliminating pressure points and allowing natural foot swelling during extended adventures.\n\nOne particular adventure stands out: a challenging 28-mile rim-to-rim Grand Canyon traverse in November. My Moab Speed models, chosen for their lightweight design and aggressive tread pattern, provided exceptional confidence during the technical descent and grueling ascent. The Vibram outsole gripped tenaciously on everything from polished limestone to loose shale, while the supportive midsole cushioned every step across unforgiving terrain.\n\nDurability has consistently exceeded expectations across all models tested. My oldest pairâ€”original Moab Ventilators purchased in 2017â€”still serves admirably for casual day hikes despite showing wear patterns from over 800 miles of use. The uppers remain structurally sound, though the tread has worn smooth in high-contact areas. This longevity represents exceptional value, especially when compared to other brands that required replacement after 300-400 miles of similar use.\n\n<h2 id=\"user-reviews\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2d5016; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #38a169; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Real User Reviews: What Hikers Actually Say</h2>\n\nThe authentic voices of fellow hikers provide invaluable insights that supplement professional reviews and manufacturer claims.

This advantage becomes particularly valuable for hikers planning significant adventures without extensive preparation time.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;\">\n    <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4YZefg4?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"background-color: #2d5016; color: white; padding: 15px 30px; border-radius: 8px; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1rem; display: inline-block; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\"><i class=\"fas fa-hiking\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\"></i>Shop Top-Rated Merrell Women's Hiking Shoes</a>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"choosing-guide\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2d5016; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #38a169; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Choosing the Perfect Merrell Hiking Shoe for Your Adventures</h2>\n\nSelecting the ideal **Merrell women's hiking shoes** requires understanding your specific hiking style, foot characteristics, and typical trail conditions. After years of testing and consultation with fellow outdoor enthusiasts, I've developed a systematic approach that eliminates guesswork and ensures optimal performance for your individual needs.\n\n<img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTCVaegwntIQlwAGvG8xMoHC5sqqgII3uHD7rol4t9vo_6devXVzm9RDclsTLFmz0AMhg_T0NYl7IXJprkE8aDScDQ3ojSLwjMlAsyqP-E54yrFseoz5Nq96g\" alt=\"Merrell Women's Moab Speed 2 Gore-Tex hiking shoes showing advanced waterproof membrane technology\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 300px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n\n**Terrain Analysis First:** Your primary hiking environments dictate essential features. Desert and dry climate hikers benefit from the breathable mesh construction found in models like the standard Moab 3, while Pacific Northwest adventurers require the robust waterproofing of <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/merrell-hiking-shoes-women-s-waterproof\" style=\"color: #38a169; font-weight: 600;\"><b>Merrell hiking shoes women's waterproof</b></a> variants. Rocky, technical terrain demands the aggressive lugging and protective toe caps found in the Moab Speed 2 series.\n\n**Distance and Load Considerations:** Day hikers carrying minimal gear can prioritize lightweight models like the Speed Strike 2, while backpackers need the enhanced support and cushioning of the Moab 3 Mid Waterproof. The additional weight becomes negligible when distributed across multi-day adventures, while the stability benefits prove invaluable during challenging descents with a loaded pack.\n\n**Foot Shape Compatibility:** Merrell's women-specific lasts accommodate various foot shapes effectively, but understanding your particular needs optimizes comfort. Wide-foot hikers should explore the generous toe boxes of <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/merrell-boulder-hiking-shoes\" style=\"color: #38a169; font-weight: 600;\"><i>Merrell Boulder hiking shoes</i></a>, while narrow-foot hikers might prefer the more snug fit of Speed Arc models. High-arch hikers consistently praise the supportive midsole construction across the entire Moab lineup.\n\n**Seasonal Performance Requirements:** Spring snowmelt and stream crossing seasons demand full waterproof protection, while summer heat calls for maximum breathability. Consider owning two pairs for year-round hikingâ€”a waterproof pair for wet conditions and a ventilated pair for dry, hot weather. This dual-shoe approach, while initially expensive, extends the lifespan of both pairs while optimizing comfort across seasons.\n\n**Budget and Value Calculations:** Entry-level hikers should consider the excellent value proposition of the standard Moab 3, which delivers 85% of premium model performance at a more accessible price point. Serious enthusiasts benefit from investing in top-tier models like the <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/merrell-trail-hiking-shoes\" style=\"color: #38a169; font-weight: 600;\"><i>Merrell Trail hiking shoes</i></a> with advanced technologies that improve performance and durability significantly.\n\nThe fitting process requires attention to detail beyond simple size selection. Always fit shoes with your preferred hiking socks, ideally in the afternoon when feet have naturally expanded. Ensure adequate toe roomâ€”approximately thumb-width clearance prevents toenail damage during extended descents. The heel should feel secure without slippage, while the midfoot provides supportive contact without pressure points.\n\n<h2 id=\"pros-and-cons\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2d5016; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #38a169; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Pros and Cons: The Complete Truth About Merrell Footwear</h2>\n\nHonest evaluation requires acknowledging both strengths and limitations of **Merrell women's hiking shoes**. After extensive testing across diverse conditions and consultation with fellow outdoor enthusiasts, here's the unvarnished truth about what these popular hiking shoes deliverâ€”and where they occasionally fall short.\n\n<div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 30px; margin: 30px 0;\">\n    <div style=\"background-color: #f0fff4; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px; border: 2px solid #38a169;\">\n        <h3 style=\"color: #2d5016; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: center;\"><i class=\"fas fa-thumbs-up\" style=\"color: #38a169; margin-right: 10px;\"></i>PROS</h3>\n        <ul style=\"list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;\">\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;\"><i class=\"fas fa-check\" style=\"color: #38a169; position: absolute; left: 0; top: 5px;\"></i><strong>Immediate Comfort:</strong> Minimal break-in period required</li>\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;\"><i class=\"fas fa-check\" style=\"color: #38a169; position: absolute; left: 0; top: 5px;\"></i><strong>Excellent Traction:</strong> Vibram outsoles perform exceptionally on varied terrain</li>\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;\"><i class=\"fas fa-check\" style=\"color: #38a169; position: absolute; left: 0; top: 5px;\"></i><strong>Wide Width Options:</strong> Accommodates diverse foot shapes effectively</li>\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;\"><i class=\"fas fa-check\" style=\"color: #38a169; position: absolute; left: 0; top: 5px;\"></i><strong>Proven Waterproofing:</strong> Reliable protection in wet conditions</li>\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;\"><i class=\"fas fa-check\" style=\"color: #38a169; position: absolute; left: 0; top: 5px;\"></i><strong>Versatile Performance:</strong> Suitable for various hiking styles and terrains</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n    \n    <div style=\"background-color: #fff5f5; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px; border: 2px solid #e53e3e;\">\n        <h3 style=\"color: #2d5016; font-size: 1.4rem; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: center;\"><i class=\"fas fa-thumbs-down\" style=\"color: #e53e3e; margin-right: 10px;\"></i>CONS</h3>\n        <ul style=\"list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;\">\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;\"><i class=\"fas fa-times\" style=\"color: #e53e3e; position: absolute; left: 0; top: 5px;\"></i><strong>Durability Concerns:</strong> Some users report premature sole separation</li>\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;\"><i class=\"fas fa-times\" style=\"color: #e53e3e; position: absolute; left: 0; top: 5px;\"></i><strong>Weight Factor:</strong> Heavier than ultralight alternatives</li>\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;\"><i class=\"fas fa-times\" style=\"color: #e53e3e; position: absolute; left: 0; top: 5px;\"></i><strong>Limited Breathability:</strong> Waterproof models can overheat in hot conditions</li>\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;\"><i class=\"fas fa-times\" style=\"color: #e53e3e; position: absolute; left: 0; top: 5px;\"></i><strong>Quality Inconsistency:</strong> Manufacturing variations affect long-term reliability</li>\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;\"><i class=\"fas fa-times\" style=\"color: #e53e3e; position: absolute; left: 0; top: 5px;\"></i><strong>Price Premium:</strong> More expensive than basic hiking footwear</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nThe durability discussion requires nuanced understanding based on extensive field testing and user feedback analysis. While some hikers report exceptional longevityâ€”my personal record holder lasted 850+ milesâ€”others experience premature failure around the 300-mile mark. This inconsistency appears linked to manufacturing variations rather than fundamental design flaws, suggesting quality control improvements could address the issue.\n\nProfessional outdoor gear reviewers at <a href=\"https://www.outdoorgearlab.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">OutdoorGearLab</a> consistently rank **Merrell women's hiking shoes** among top performers for value and versatility, while acknowledging the weight penalty compared to ultralight alternatives. The trade-off between durability and weight becomes a personal preference based on hiking style and priorities.\n\nEnvironmental considerations favor Merrell's sustainability initiatives, including recycled material incorporation and responsible manufacturing practices. However, the relatively shorter lifespan compared to premium leather boots raises questions about overall environmental impact through more frequent replacement cycles.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/merrell-hydro-hiking-shoes\" style=\"color: #38a169; font-weight: 600;\"><b>Merrell Hydro hiking shoes</b></a> represent the brand's innovative approach to water-specific challenges, though they occupy a niche market segment. For mainstream hiking applications, the proven Moab lineup continues delivering reliable performance despite acknowledged limitations.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 30px 0; padding: 20px; background-color: #f7fafc; border-radius: 8px;\">\n    <a href=\"https://amzn.to/5ZAbcd6?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"background-color: #e53e3e; color: white; padding: 15px 30px; border-radius: 8px; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1rem; display: inline-block; margin: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\"><i class=\"fas fa-percentage\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\"></i>Shop Current Deals &amp; Discounts</a>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2d5016; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #38a169; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Conclusion</h2>\n\nAfter 1,500+ miles of rigorous testing across North America's most challenging terrain, **Merrell women's hiking shoes** consistently prove their reputation as America's preferred trail footwear. While no hiking shoe achieves perfection, Merrell's combination of immediate comfort, proven traction, and versatile performance makes them the logical choice for most female hikers.\n\nThe Moab 3 Waterproof emerges as my top recommendation for all-around performance, delivering reliable protection and comfort across diverse conditions. Budget-conscious hikers will find excellent value in the standard Moab 3, while speed-focused adventurers should consider the lightweight Moab Speed 2 series. For those requiring ankle support on technical terrain, the Mid versions provide confidence-inspiring stability.\n\nUnderstanding the limitationsâ€”particularly potential durability concerns and weight considerationsâ€”allows informed decision-making. The key lies in matching specific models to your hiking style, terrain preferences, and performance priorities. <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/merrell-women's-hiking-shoes\" style=\"color: #38a169; font-weight: 600;\"><i>Merrell women's hiking shoes</i></a> continue evolving with new technologies and improved materials, suggesting even better performance in future iterations.\n\nMy personal journey from skeptical newcomer to committed advocate reflects the experience of thousands of female hikers who've discovered the confidence that comes from reliable, comfortable footwear.

This extra room accommodates natural foot swelling during long hikes and prevents toenail damage on steep descents. Always try shoes with your preferred hiking socks, and remember that feet naturally expand throughout the day, so afternoon fittings provide more accurate sizing. The Moab series particularly benefits from this half-size adjustment, ensuring optimal comfort during multi-mile adventures.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d5016; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">How long do Merrell women's hiking shoes typically last?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.7;\">Based on extensive testing and user feedback analysis, Merrell women's hiking shoes typically last 300-800 miles depending on terrain, usage patterns, and individual gait characteristics. My personal experience shows average longevity around 500-600 miles for regular trail use. Factors affecting durability include hiking surface roughness, frequency of use, and proper care maintenance. Some users report exceptional durability exceeding 1000 miles, while others experience earlier wear around 250-300 miles. Rotating between multiple pairs and avoiding pavement hiking significantly extends lifespan.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d5016; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Do Merrell hiking shoes require a break-in period?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.7;\">One of Merrell's greatest advantages is minimal break-in requirements compared to traditional leather hiking boots. Most models feel comfortable immediately, though I recommend 20-30 miles of gradually increasing hikes for optimal fit adaptation. The synthetic materials and pre-shaped construction eliminate the extensive conditioning period required by leather alternatives. Start with shorter day hikes before attempting extended adventures, allowing your feet to adjust to the specific support characteristics and ensuring no pressure points develop during longer wear periods.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d5016; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Which Merrell model is best for wide feet?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.7;\">The Merrell Moab series, particularly the Moab 3 and Moab 3 Waterproof, offers the most accommodating fit for wide feet through generous toe boxes and available wide-width sizing. These models feature roomier construction that prevents cramping and hot spots common with narrow-lasted hiking shoes. The Bravada 2 also provides excellent wide-foot accommodation at a more budget-friendly price point. Always select wide-width versions when available, and consider the mesh upper models for additional stretch and adaptation to individual foot shapes during extended wear.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d5016; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Are waterproof Merrell shoes worth the extra cost?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.7;\">Waterproof Merrell models justify their premium pricing for hikers frequently encountering wet conditions, stream crossings, or spring snowmelt scenarios. The membrane technology effectively prevents water infiltration while maintaining reasonable breathability for moderate temperatures. However, hot climate hikers should prioritize ventilated models for superior cooling and moisture management. Consider your typical hiking conditions: Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, and mountain environment hikers benefit significantly from waterproof protection, while desert and dry climate adventurers rarely need this feature. The versatility of owning both waterproof and ventilated pairs optimizes performance year-round.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"color: #2d5016; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Can Merrell hiking shoes be used for backpacking with heavy loads?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.7;\">Merrell hiking shoes perform admirably for backpacking with moderate loads (25-35 pounds), though heavier loads benefit from mid-height models like the Moab 3 Mid Waterproof for enhanced ankle support. The supportive midsole construction and stable platform handle pack weight effectively, while the lower profile offers superior agility compared to traditional boots. I've successfully completed multi-day backpacking trips carrying 30+ pounds in various Merrell models without discomfort or stability issues. Consider your typical pack weight, terrain difficulty, and personal ankle stability when choosing between low and mid-height options for backpacking applications.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n  \"headline\": \"The Ultimate Guide to Merrell Women's Hiking Shoes: Expert Reviews, Trail-Tested Rankings & Buying Guide 2025\",\n  \"description\": \"Comprehensive expert guide to Merrell women's hiking shoes with 1,500+ miles of trail testing, real user reviews, and detailed buying recommendations for every adventure.\",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Person\",\n    \"name\": \"Trail Expert\"\n  },\n  \"datePublished\": \"2025-01-19\",\n  \"dateModified\": \"2025-01-19\",\n  \"image\": \"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQy9QqpIe0Yyy6lVyNCfxlbVireFq5d-nFScrQrmYJGrzrvOzMA8w97YWTF3cm76aontjZNDLDjxxwHQZxBbIdRPWgcYUzVPaJfs9bpT3CJwFhbPLvpG25ALQ\",\n  \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n    \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n    \"@id\": \"https://explorenationalparks.store/merrell-womens-hiking-shoes-guide\"\n  },\n  \"publisher\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n    \"name\": \"Explore National Parks Store\",\n    \"logo\": {\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n      \"url\": \"https://explorenationalparks.store/logo.png\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"keywords\": \"merrell women's hiking shoes, hiking boots, trail shoes, waterproof hiking shoes, Moab 3, outdoor gear\",\n  \"wordCount\": 2847,\n  \"articleSection\": \"Hiking Gear Reviews\",\n  \"mainEntity\": {\n    \"@id\": \"#faq\"\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"Are Merrell women's hiking shoes true to size?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"Most Merrell women's hiking shoes run true to size, but I recommend sizing up half a size for extended hiking adventures.
