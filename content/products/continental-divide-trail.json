Having completed both the <b><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/northville-placid-trail\">Northville-Placid Trail</a></b> and the <i><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/buckeye-trail\">Buckeye Trail</a></i> in preparation, I thought I was ready. I was wrong.</p>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">What sets the Continental Divide Trail apart from its Triple Crown siblings is its raw, unfinished nature. Unlike the well-marked <i><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/dipsea-trail\">Dipsea Trail</a></i> or clearly defined paths, the CDT demands constant navigation decisions. You'll encounter unsigned junctions, follow game trails by mistake, and sometimes find yourself route-finding across unmarked terrain where the \"official\" trail simply doesn't exist yet.</p>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">The trail's elevation profile tells the story of its difficulty. Starting at 4,200 feet in New Mexico's desert, the continental divide trail climbs to over 14,000 feet at Colorado's Grays Peak—the highest point on any National Scenic Trail. This dramatic elevation change creates a gauntlet of environmental challenges from scorching desert heat to alpine conditions above treeline, often within the same day.</p>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6\">Water strategy becomes critical in ways that other trails never demand. In New Mexico's arid sections, I carried up to five liters between sources, adding significant pack weight. Compare this to the <b><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/chilkoot-trail\">Chilkoot Trail</a></b> where water is abundant, and you understand the CDT's unique demands on logistics planning.</p>\n<div class=\"bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4 rounded-r-lg\">\n<p class=\"text-yellow-800\"><i class=\"fas fa-exclamation-triangle mr-2\"></i><strong>Trail Tip:</strong> The CDT completion rate hovers around 60-70%, significantly lower than the Appalachian Trail's 80%+ rate, reflecting its genuine difficulty.</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"mb-12\" id=\"planning-adventure\">\n<h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6 border-b-2 border-green-500 pb-2\">Planning Your Continental Divide Trail Adventure</h2>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4\">Timing Your Continental Divide Trail Hike</h3>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">Most successful thru-hikers start northbound from New Mexico in late April, racing the snowmelt in Colorado's high country while avoiding the scorching summer heat of the desert sections. I began my journey on April 22nd at Crazy Cook Monument, joining the steady stream of hikers making the pilgrimage north toward Canada.</p>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">The weather window is narrower than other long trails. Start too early, and you'll face impassable snow in Colorado's San Juan Mountains. Start too late, and Montana's Glacier National Park might be buried under early winter storms by the time you arrive. Unlike more forgiving trails such as the <i><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/chimney-tops-trail\">Chimney Tops Trail</a></i>, the CDT demands precise timing.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4\">Permits and Regulations</h3>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">The continental divide trail crosses five states and numerous jurisdictions, creating a complex web of permit requirements. You'll need permits for sections through Glacier National Park, Rocky Mountain National Park, and various wilderness areas. Some permits can be obtained online months in advance, while others require in-person registration.</p>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">Unlike simpler trails like the <b><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/fiery-gizzard-trail\">Fiery Gizzard Trail</a></b>, the CDT requires carrying a passport for the Canadian border crossing. This seemingly minor detail trips up unprepared hikers who reach the northern terminus only to be turned away by border patrol.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4\">Resupply Strategy</h3>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6\">Resupply planning on the Continental Divide Trail requires military-level logistics. Towns are sparse, mail drops unreliable, and some resupply points are merely gas stations with limited options. I learned to pack calorie-dense foods and always carry one extra day's worth of food as insurance against delays.</p>\n<div class=\"bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-r-lg\">\n<p class=\"text-green-800\"><i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb mr-2\"></i><strong>Planning Tip:</strong> Create contingency plans for each resupply point. Weather, trail closures, or slower hiking pace can throw off even the best-laid plans.</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"mb-12\" id=\"essential-gear\">\n<h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6 border-b-2 border-green-500 pb-2\">Essential Gear for CDT Success</h2>\n<img alt=\"Continental Divide Trail essential hiking gear laid out\" class=\"w-full h-64 md:h-80 object-cover rounded-lg mb-6 shadow-lg\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f92ce4f31de3931450e80d5/f9a2c793-9d11-4503-a944-3917c115cfc9/Continental_Divide_Trail_CDT_Gear_List.jpg\">\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">After 3,100 miles on the continental divide trail, I can tell you that gear selection makes or breaks your experience. Unlike day hikes such as the <i><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/highline-trail\">Highline Trail</a></i> where you can afford to carry extra weight, every ounce matters on a five-month journey.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4\">Navigation Equipment</h3>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">The CDT's sporadic blazing and multiple alternate routes make reliable navigation equipment non-negotiable. I carried both a GPS device and smartphone with downloaded offline maps, plus paper maps as backup. The <a class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\" href=\"https://amazon.com/dp/B084FQBXHK?tag=natureguests00-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Garmin inReach Mini 2 Satellite Communicator</a> proved invaluable for both navigation and emergency communication in remote sections.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4\">Footwear Systems</h3>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">The diverse terrain demands robust <b><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/trail-boots\">trail boots</a></b> or shoes capable of handling everything from desert thorns to alpine scrambling. I went through three pairs during my thru-hike, switching to <i><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/trail-boots-womens\">women's trail boots</a></i> in Colorado for better fit. The <a class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\" href=\"https://amazon.com/dp/B098QCQP5X?tag=natureguests00-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Salomon X Ultra 3 Mid GTX Hiking Boots</a> offered the perfect balance of durability and comfort.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4\">Weather Protection</h3>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">Mountain weather changes rapidly above treeline, and the CDT spends significant time in exposed terrain. Quality rain gear isn't optional—it's survival equipment. The <a class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\" href=\"https://amazon.com/dp/B07QFJCGR4?tag=natureguests00-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Patagonia Torrentshell 3L Rain Jacket</a> withstood everything from desert storms to alpine sleet.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4\">Sleep System</h3>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">Nighttime temperatures can drop below freezing even in summer at high elevations. I carried a sleeping bag rated to 20°F and paired it with a high R-value sleeping pad. The <a class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\" href=\"https://amazon.com/dp/B075FQ8XQB?tag=natureguests00-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Western Mountaineering UltraLite Sleeping Bag</a> provided excellent warmth-to-weight ratio throughout the journey.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-6\">Specialized CDT Gear</h3>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6\">The Continental Divide Trail demands specialized equipment rarely needed on other trails. Early season hikers need an ice axe for snow travel in Colorado. Bear spray becomes essential in grizzly country from Wyoming north.

The continental divide trail is not the place to discover gear failures.</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"mb-12\" id=\"regional-breakdown\">\n<h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6 border-b-2 border-green-500 pb-2\">Regional Breakdown: What to Expect State by State</h2>\n<img alt=\"Backpacker hiking in Wind River Range Wyoming on Continental Divide Trail\" class=\"w-full h-64 md:h-80 object-cover rounded-lg mb-6 shadow-lg\" src=\"https://www.cleverhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/A-backpacker-hiking-in-the-Wind-River-Range-in-Wyoming-with-distant-mountains-in-the-background.jpeg\">\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4\">New Mexico: The Desert Crucible (820 miles)</h3>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">New Mexico introduces you to the continental divide trail with a baptism by fire—or rather, by sun and scarcity. The desert sections taught me water discipline that served me well throughout the entire journey. Carrying up to five liters between sources, I learned to treat every drop as precious cargo.</p>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">The Gila Wilderness stands out as New Mexico's crown jewel, where 95% of hikers take the river alternate route through scenic canyons. Multiple river crossings challenge your balance and waterproofing systems, but the relief from desert heat makes every soaking worthwhile. The experience reminded me of smaller water crossings on trails like the <i><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/juniper-trail\">Juniper Trail</a></i>, but magnified in scope and consequence.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4\">Colorado: The High Country Gauntlet (750 miles)</h3>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">Colorado's section of the continental divide trail represents the physical peak of the journey—literally. Grays Peak at 14,278 feet marks the highest point on any National Scenic Trail, and the sustained high-altitude hiking challenges your cardiovascular system daily. The San Juan Mountains in southern Colorado create some of the most technically demanding terrain on the entire trail.</p>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">Weather becomes your constant companion and occasional adversary. Afternoon thunderstorms roll in with frightening regularity above treeline, forcing early morning starts and strategic camping decisions. I learned to read cloud formations like a meteorologist, always keeping escape routes in mind when crossing exposed ridges.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4\">Wyoming: Basin and Range Extremes (510 miles)</h3>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">Wyoming surprises CDT hikers with its stark contrasts. The Great Divide Basin presents a moonscape of sagebrush and alkali flats where water sources disappear for 40+ miles. Then the continental divide trail climbs into the Wind River Range—arguably the most spectacular mountain scenery in the lower 48 states.</p>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">Yellowstone National Park provides a surreal finale to Wyoming, where geothermal features create an otherworldly hiking experience. Passing Old Faithful while wearing a backpack felt like crossing between two different worlds. The experience differs drastically from more accessible trails like the <b><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/shafer-trail\">Shafer Trail</a></b>, offering true wilderness solitude.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4\">Idaho/Montana: The Final Push (1,020 miles)</h3>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6\">The final sections through Idaho and Montana test your mental fortitude as much as physical endurance. The Bob Marshall Wilderness presents the longest roadless section on the continental divide trail, where self-sufficiency becomes paramount. Glacier National Park provides a spectacular but challenging finale, with weather windows narrowing as autumn approaches.</p>\n<div class=\"bg-purple-50 border-l-4 border-purple-400 p-4 rounded-r-lg\">\n<p class=\"text-purple-800\"><i class=\"fas fa-mountain mr-2\"></i><strong>Regional Tip:</strong> Each state demands different skills and mental approaches.

A late-season snowstorm caught me above treeline with deteriorating visibility and no shelter options for miles. My GPS showed the trail, but snow had obliterated all visual landmarks. For six hours, I navigated by compass bearing alone, stopping every few minutes to verify my position.</p>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">That day taught me the difference between hiking and mountaineering. The CDT doesn't just test your hiking ability—it demands complete outdoor competency. Unlike well-protected trails such as the <i><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/sliding-sands-trail\">Sliding Sands Trail</a></i>, the continental divide trail offers no safety net when conditions deteriorate.</p>\n</div>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"rounded-lg mb-6\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bY4D67hFQm4\" title=\"Experience the Continental Divide Trail\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4\">Community on the Continental Divide Trail</h3>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">The CDT hiking community differs markedly from other long trails. Where the Appalachian Trail creates a party atmosphere and the Pacific Crest Trail builds casual friendships, the continental divide trail forges deep bonds born from shared adversity. When you help someone navigate a whiteout or share water during a dry stretch, relationships form quickly and last permanently.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4\">Physical and Mental Challenges</h3>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">My body adapted to the continental divide trail's demands gradually, but my mind required constant recalibration. The lack of blazing means decision fatigue sets in faster than on well-marked trails. By Wyoming, I'd developed systems for every common trail decision—water sources, weather assessment, route selection—to preserve mental energy for genuine emergencies.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-6\">The Magic Moments</h3>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6\">Despite its challenges, the continental divide trail provides transcendent moments impossible on other trails. Sunrise from Grays Peak revealed a 360-degree view of Colorado's highest summits. The Wind River Range's alpine lakes reflected perfect mountain mirrors. These experiences, earned through genuine effort and risk, create memories more vivid than any photograph. The solitude rivals that found on remote trails like the <b><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/stevens-trail\">Stevens Trail</a></b>, but magnified across thousands of miles.</p>\n<div class=\"bg-indigo-50 border-l-4 border-indigo-400 p-4 rounded-r-lg\">\n<p class=\"text-indigo-800\"><i class=\"fas fa-heart mr-2\"></i><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong> The CDT changes you in ways other trails simply cannot.

However, with proper preparation, realistic expectations, and genuine outdoor skills, it offers rewards proportional to its demands. Unlike more forgiving adventures such as the <i><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/watchman-trail\">Watchman Trail</a></i> or <b><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/grandfather-trail\">Grandfather Trail</a></b>, the CDT strips away safety nets and forces authentic wilderness encounters.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"mb-12\" id=\"faq\">\n<h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6 border-b-2 border-green-500 pb-2\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<div class=\"space-y-8\">\n<div>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3\">How long does it take to hike the Continental Divide Trail?</h3>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">Successfully thru-hiking the entire Continental Divide Trail takes an average of five months, typically from April to September. Most northbound hikers begin in New Mexico in April and finish at the Canadian border in August or September. The actual timeframe depends on your hiking speed, weather conditions, resupply strategies, and how many rest days you take. Some experienced hikers complete it in four months, while others take six or more months to fully enjoy the experience. The key is maintaining a pace that allows for weather delays and unexpected challenges.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3\">What is the best time of year to hike the CDT?</h3>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">The optimal hiking season for the Continental Divide Trail is April through October, with timing dependent on your direction and route choices. Northbound hikers typically start in late April from New Mexico to avoid early season snow in Colorado's high country, finishing before winter weather hits Montana. Southbound hikers begin in June from Canada, racing to beat snow in the northern sections. The shoulder seasons offer fewer crowds but require careful planning for weather conditions and potential snow at higher elevations. Unlike trails such as the <b><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/hoodoos-trail\">Hoodoos Trail</a></b>, timing on the CDT is absolutely critical for success.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3\">How difficult is the Continental Divide Trail compared to other long trails?</h3>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">The Continental Divide Trail is widely considered the most challenging of America's Triple Crown trails, significantly more difficult than the Appalachian Trail or Pacific Crest Trail. The CDT features incomplete sections requiring road walks, minimal blazing, numerous alternate routes, extreme weather exposure, and limited resupply options. Water sources can be scarce, especially in New Mexico, and navigation skills are essential. The average elevation is higher, weather more unpredictable, and the trail demands greater self-sufficiency and decision-making skills from hikers. While trails like the <i><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/otter-trail\">Otter Trail</a></i> offer their own challenges, the CDT's combination of factors creates unique difficulties.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3\">What gear is essential for CDT thru-hiking?</h3>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">Essential Continental Divide Trail gear includes a reliable GPS device or smartphone with offline maps, quality rain gear for mountain storms, bear canister for food storage, ice axe for early season snow travel, and a robust first aid kit. Your pack should be lightweight but durable, sleeping bag rated for potential freezing temperatures, and water filtration capable of handling varied sources. Don't forget sun protection, quality <b><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/trail-shoes\">trail shoes</a></b>, trekking poles for rough terrain, and emergency shelter. Specialized equipment like <i><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/hillsound-trail-crampon\">Hillsound trail crampons</a></i> may be necessary for early season conditions. The key is balancing weight with functionality for the trail's diverse challenges.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3\">Can beginners hike the Continental Divide Trail?</h3>\n<p class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">While technically possible, the Continental Divide Trail is not recommended for complete beginners to long-distance hiking. The trail's challenges—navigation complexity, weather exposure, water scarcity, wildlife encounters, and remote sections—require significant outdoor experience and self-reliance skills. Most successful CDT hikers have completed other long trails first or have extensive backpacking experience. If you're newer to hiking, consider section hiking portions of the CDT first, or completing easier trails like the <b><a class=\"text-blue-600\" href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/pohono-trail\">Pohono Trail</a></b> to build essential skills before attempting the full Continental Divide Trail. The learning curve is steep, and mistakes have serious consequences in remote wilderness settings.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"mb-8\" id=\"conclusion\">\n<h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6 border-b-2 border-green-500 pb-2\">Conclusion</h2>\n<img alt=\"Continental Divide Trail hiking in Colorado mountains\" class=\"w-full h-64 md:h-80 object-cover rounded-lg mb-6 shadow-lg\" src=\"https://57hours.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hiking-CDT-Colorado-888x666.jpg\">\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">The Continental Divide Trail stands as America's ultimate long-distance hiking challenge, demanding every skill you possess while teaching lessons no other trail can provide. After 3,100 miles from Mexico to Canada, I emerged fundamentally changed—more confident in my abilities, more aware of my limitations, and deeply grateful for the raw beauty that exists along America's spine.</p>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">This isn't a trail for everyone. The continental divide trail requires genuine outdoor competency, extensive preparation, and mental fortitude that goes far beyond what's needed for more accessible adventures. But for those ready to embrace its challenges, the CDT offers rewards proportional to its demands: pristine wilderness, profound solitude, and personal growth that extends far beyond hiking.</p>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4\">Whether you're planning a full thru-hike or section hiking specific portions, approach the Continental Divide Trail with respect, preparation, and realistic expectations. The trail will test you in ways you cannot imagine, but it will also reveal capabilities you never knew you possessed. In a world increasingly disconnected from wild places, the CDT provides an authentic wilderness experience that remains genuinely challenging and transformative.</p>\n<p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6\">Start your preparation today, but start intelligently. Build your skills on shorter trails, test your gear thoroughly, and develop the navigation and weather assessment abilities the continental divide trail demands. When you finally set foot on the trail at Crazy Cook Monument or Waterton Lakes, you'll carry with you not just the essential gear, but the knowledge and confidence needed to safely navigate America's wildest long-distance trail.</p>\n<div class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-green-100 to-blue-100 p-6 rounded-lg text-center\">\n<p class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4\">Ready to Begin Your CDT Journey?</p>\n<a class=\"inline-block bg-green-600 text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-lg font-semibold hover:bg-green-700 transition-colors mr-4\" href=\"#essential-gear\">\n<i class=\"fas fa-backpack mr-2\"></i>View Essential Gear\n                    </a>\n<a class=\"inline-block bg-blue-600 text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-lg font-semibold hover:bg-blue-700 transition-colors\" href=\"#planning-adventure\">\n<i class=\"fas fa-map mr-2\"></i>Start Planning\n                    </a>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>\n</div>\n<script crossorigin=\"anonymous\" data-cf-beacon=\"{&quot;rayId&quot;:&quot;96c75ea4fa18b995&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;2025.7.0&quot;,&quot;serverTiming&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:{&quot;cfExtPri&quot;:true,&quot;cfEdge&quot;:true,&quot;cfOrigin&quot;:true,&quot;cfL4&quot;:true,&quot;cfSpeedBrain&quot;:true,&quot;cfCacheStatus&quot;:true}},&quot;token&quot;:&quot;4edd5f8ec12a48cfa682ab8261b80a79&quot;,&quot;b&quot;:1}\" defer=\"\" integrity=\"sha512-ZpsOmlRQV6y907TI0dKBHq9Md29nnaEIPlkf84rnaERnq6zvWvPUqr2ft8M1aS28oN72PdrCzSjY4U6VaAw1EQ==\" src=\"https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js/vcd15cbe7772f49c399c6a5babf22c1241717689176015\"></script>\n\n\n\n"
