What started as a desperate need for fresh air turned into my favorite weekly ritual. This 2.5-mile round trip hike from Griffith Observatory has become my go-to recommendation for anyone visiting Los Angeles, and for good reason.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">My most memorable experience happened last spring during wildflower season. I arrived at the Charlie Turner Trailhead just after sunrise, armed with my trusty <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/alltrail\" style=\"color: #4a90e2; text-decoration: none;\"><strong>AllTrails</strong></a> app and a determination to beat the crowds. The morning air was crisp, and as I began the ascent through Berlin Forest, the city's usual haze hadn't yet settled in. The trail was quiet except for the occasional hiker and their leashed dogsâ€”a reminder that this is one of LA's most dog-friendly hiking spots.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">What struck me most was the gradual revelation of views. Unlike some trails that save the best for last, the <strong>Mt Hollywood trail</strong> offers increasingly spectacular vistas at every turn. About halfway up, I encountered a park ranger who shared invaluable local knowledge: \"The secret,\" he told me, \"is timing your hike for golden hour, either sunrise or sunset. That's when the city truly comes alive below you.\" His advice proved goldenâ€”literally.</p>\n<div style=\"background: #fff9e6; border-left: 4px solid #ffd700; padding: 20px; margin: 25px 0; border-radius: 5px;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0; font-style: italic;\"><strong>Pro Tip from My Experience:</strong> The trail can get crowded after 10 AM on weekends, but weekday mornings offer a completely different experience.

This strategic starting point isn't coincidentalâ€”it positions you perfectly for post-hike exploration of one of LA's most iconic landmarks. I've learned through experience that parking can make or break your hiking day, especially on weekends.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">During my early hiking attempts, I made the rookie mistake of arriving at the observatory around noon on a Saturday. After circling the parking lot three times, I finally found a spot but paid dearly for itâ€”both financially and in terms of stress. Now I always recommend the alternative approach: park near the Greek Theatre for free and extend your hike by about 0.5 miles each way. This route actually enhanced my experience, as I discovered additional <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/famousfootwear\" style=\"color: #4a90e2; text-decoration: none;\"><i>trails that require proper footwear</i></a> throughout Griffith Park.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">From downtown LA, take the 5 Freeway to Los Feliz Boulevard, then follow signs to Griffith Observatory. The winding road up Western Canyon provides a scenic prelude to your hike, with glimpses of the trail system you'll soon be exploring. I particularly enjoy this approach in the early morning when the city is still waking up and the light filters beautifully through the canyon.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 30px 0;\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hnw63pKMc04\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 400px; border: none; border-radius: 10px;\"></iframe>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px; color: #666;\">Experience the Mt Hollywood trail through this comprehensive hiking video guide</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"what-to-expect\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2c5530; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; border-bottom: 2px solid #4a90e2; padding-bottom: 10px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-binoculars\" style=\"margin-right: 10px; color: #4a90e2;\"></i>What to Expect on the Hike</h2>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<img alt=\"Berlin Forest section of Mt Hollywood trail with pine trees and Hollywood Sign views\" src=\"https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mt-hollywood-4-640x427.jpg\" style=\"flex: 1; min-width: 300px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\">\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">The <strong>Mt Hollywood trail</strong> unfolds like a well-choreographed performance, with each section offering distinct experiences and challenges. After countless hikes on this trail, I've identified several key landmarks that serve as natural waypoints and rest stops.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Your journey begins with a gentle ascent through shaded tree coverageâ€”a blessing during summer months. The first major landmark is Berlin Forest, approximately 0.3 miles from the trailhead. This grove of pine trees was planted to commemorate the sister-city relationship between Los Angeles and Berlin. I've found this area particularly peaceful in early morning hours, when the filtered sunlight creates almost cathedral-like conditions. The benches here offer the first good views of the Hollywood Sign, perfectly framed by pine boughs.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Continuing past Berlin Forest, the trail opens up significantly, transforming from a woodland path to a wide fire road. This section provides consistent views and steady climbing. I appreciate how the <strong>Mt Hollywood trail</strong> maintains a manageable grade throughoutâ€”never so steep as to be discouraging, but challenging enough to provide a genuine workout. The improved <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/brunt-boots\" style=\"color: #4a90e2; text-decoration: none;\"><b>hiking boots</b></a> I invested in last year made a noticeable difference in comfort during this section.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">The trail's halfway point presents a crucial decision: continue straight toward Dante's View or take the left fork toward Captain's Roost. Both destinations offer unique perspectives, but I typically recommend Dante's View for first-time hikers. This well-maintained rest area features picnic tables, a water fountain, and arguably the best panoramic views of downtown LA and the San Gabriel Mountains. The volunteers who maintain this area have created something truly specialâ€”it feels like a secret garden suspended above the city.</p>\n<div style=\"background: #f0f8ff; border: 2px solid #4a90e2; padding: 20px; margin: 25px 0; border-radius: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Trail Highlights You Won't Want to Miss:</h3>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Berlin Forest:</strong> Perfect Instagram spot with Hollywood Sign backdrop</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Dante's View:</strong> Best panoramic city views and water fountain</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Captain's Roost:</strong> Palm tree vista point ideal for sunset photos</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Summit Views:</strong> 360-degree panorama including ocean on clear days</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"essential-gear\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2c5530; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; border-bottom: 2px solid #4a90e2; padding-bottom: 10px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-backpack\" style=\"margin-right: 10px; color: #4a90e2;\"></i>Essential Gear for Mt Hollywood Trail</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">After years of hiking the <strong>Mt Hollywood trail</strong> in various conditions and seasons, I've refined my gear recommendations to focus on items that truly enhance the experience.

The trail's popularity means cell service is generally excellent, but I still recommend downloading offline maps through apps like <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/alltrail\" style=\"color: #4a90e2; text-decoration: none;\"><i>AllTrails</i></a> as a backup.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">For photography enthusiasts, the <strong>Mt Hollywood trail</strong> offers endless opportunities. I've found that a lightweight tripod significantly improves sunset and sunrise shots, particularly for capturing the city lights as they begin to twinkle in the early evening. The trail's various viewpoints accommodate different focal lengths, from wide-angle panoramas to telephoto shots of the Hollywood Sign.</p>\n<div style=\"background: #fff0f5; border-left: 4px solid #ff69b4; padding: 20px; margin: 25px 0; border-radius: 5px;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Seasonal Gear Adjustments:</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\"><strong>Summer:</strong> Extra water, wide-brimmed hat, cooling towel<br>\n<strong>Winter:</strong> Light jacket for summit winds, layers for temperature changes<br>\n<strong>Spring:</strong> Camera for wildflower photography, allergy medication if needed<br>\n<strong>Fall:</strong> Light layers for variable temperatures, extra time for golden hour photos</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"best-times\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2c5530; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; border-bottom: 2px solid #4a90e2; padding-bottom: 10px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-sun\" style=\"margin-right: 10px; color: #4a90e2;\"></i>Best Times to Hike and Seasonal Tips</h2>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<img alt=\"Sunset view from Mt Hollywood trail summit showing LA skyline and golden hour lighting\" src=\"https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mt-hollywood-21-640x427.jpg\" style=\"flex: 1; min-width: 300px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\">\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Timing can make or break your <strong>Mt Hollywood trail</strong> experience. After hiking this trail in every season and at virtually every time of day, I've developed strong opinions about when this trail truly shines. The magic hoursâ€”sunrise and sunsetâ€”transform this already spectacular hike into something transcendent.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">My personal favorite time is the hour before sunrise on clear mornings, particularly during fall and winter months when the air is crisp and visibility extends to the Pacific Ocean. Starting in darkness with a headlamp might seem daunting, but watching the city wake up below you is unforgettable. I've witnessed dozens of sunrises from the summit, and each one feels like a private performance. The challenge lies in motivationâ€”few people are willing to start hiking at 5:30 AM, but those who do are rewarded with solitude and photographic opportunities impossible to achieve during peak hours.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Summer hiking requires careful planning due to LA's intense heat and sun exposure. The trail offers minimal shade beyond the initial tree cover, making early morning starts essential between June and September. I typically recommend beginning no later than 7 AM during summer months. However, summer evenings present magical opportunities for sunset hikes. The extended daylight hours mean you can start your ascent around 6 PM and still have plenty of time to reach the summit before golden hour.</p>\n<div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr)); gap: 20px; margin: 30px 0;\">\n<div style=\"background: #e6f3ff; border-radius: 10px; padding: 20px; border-top: 4px solid #4a90e2;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-snowflake\" style=\"color: #87ceeb;\"></i> Winter (Dec-Feb)</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Best Times:</strong> 8 AM - 4 PM</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Weather:</strong> Cool mornings, mild days</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\"><strong>Highlights:</strong> Clear views, fewer crowds, crisp air.

My personal favorite season for this trail.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Weather conditions significantly impact your <strong>Mt Hollywood trail</strong> experience. I've hiked this trail in everything from clear Santa Ana wind conditions (offering incredible visibility to Catalina Island) to post-rain days when waterfalls temporarily appear on surrounding hillsides. The most challenging conditions I've encountered were during high wind events, which can make the exposed summit uncomfortable and potentially unsafe for inexperienced hikers.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">For those interested in similar experiences throughout LA's hiking scene, I highly recommend exploring other trails that offer comparable views with different perspectives. The <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/manitou-incline\" style=\"color: #4a90e2; text-decoration: none;\"><b>Manitou Incline</b></a> provides a more challenging alternative, while trails throughout Angeles National Forest offer wilderness experiences beyond the urban hiking that characterizes Griffith Park.</p>\n<h2 id=\"safety-tips\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2c5530; margin: 40px 0 20px 0; border-bottom: 2px solid #4a90e2; padding-bottom: 10px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-shield-alt\" style=\"margin-right: 10px; color: #4a90e2;\"></i>Safety Tips and Trail Etiquette</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">While the <strong>Mt Hollywood trail</strong> is considered one of LA's safer hiking destinations, maintaining proper safety awareness ensures an enjoyable experience for everyone. Through my extensive time on this trail, I've observed patterns that can help both new and experienced hikers stay safe and comfortable.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">The most significant safety consideration isn't wildlife or terrainâ€”it's other trail users. This trail's popularity means you'll encounter runners, dog walkers, families with children, and photographers, sometimes all simultaneously. I've learned to maintain heightened awareness, particularly on the wider fire road sections where mountain bikers occasionally venture despite regulations. Always hiking with proper <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/aetrex-shoes\" style=\"color: #4a90e2; text-decoration: none;\"><i>supportive footwear</i></a> has prevented several potential ankle injuries on uneven surfaces.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Wildlife encounters, while less common than on more remote trails, do occur. I've spotted coyotes twice during early morning hikes, both times at a respectful distance. The key is making noise and traveling in groups when possible. More commonly, you'll encounter various bird species and occasionally deer, particularly near Dante's View where the maintained vegetation attracts wildlife. rattlesnakes are present in the area, though I've only seen one in three years of regular hiking. Staying on designated trails and watching where you step or sit provides adequate protection.</p>\n<div style=\"background: #ffebcd; border: 2px solid #daa520; padding: 20px; margin: 25px 0; border-radius: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-exclamation-triangle\" style=\"color: #ff4500;\"></i> Essential Safety Reminders:</h3>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Start early to avoid afternoon heat and crowds</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Carry more water than you think you needâ€”minimum 32 oz per person</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Inform someone of your hiking plans and expected return time</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Stay on designated trails to prevent erosion and protect vegetation</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Keep dogs leashed at all timesâ€”it's required and courteous</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Pack out all trash, including organic waste like fruit peels</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Trail etiquette on the <strong>Mt Hollywood trail</strong> follows standard hiking protocols, but the high traffic volume makes consideration especially important. Uphill hikers have the right of way, though I often step aside regardless of direction to allow faster-moving trail runners to pass safely. Photography is popular here, but I've noticed some visitors blocking paths or venturing off-trail for shots. Patience and communication usually resolve any conflicts.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Emergency preparedness on this trail differs from remote hiking situations due to excellent cell coverage and relatively quick access for emergency responders. However, I still recommend basic first aid knowledge and supplies, particularly for minor scrapes or sprains that could occur on the rockier sections. The proximity to Griffith Observatory means help is never far away, but self-sufficiency remains important.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Weather-related safety considerations vary significantly by season. Summer's heat poses the greatest risk, with dehydration and heat exhaustion possible for unprepared hikers. I've assisted several people who underestimated the intensity of Southern California sun at elevation. Winter hiking presents different challenges, primarily related to sudden weather changes and slippery conditions during the rare rain events.</p>\n<div style=\"background: #e8f8f5; border-left: 4px solid #00c851; padding: 20px; margin: 25px 0; border-radius: 5px;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Community User Reviews:</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><strong>Sarah from Reddit:</strong> \"The trail is well-maintained but can get dusty.

This trail perfectly balances challenge with accessibility, offering genuine rewards for minimal technical difficulty. Whether you're a seasoned hiker seeking a quick workout with spectacular views or a visitor wanting to experience LA from a unique perspective, this trail delivers consistently.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">The trail's greatest strength lies in its versatility. I've used it for solo contemplation during stressful periods, photography expeditions during golden hour, family outings with visiting relatives, and social hikes with fellow outdoor enthusiasts. Each experience revealed new aspects of both the trail and the city below. The seasonal changes, from spring wildflowers to winter's crystal-clear air, ensure that regular visitors never experience exactly the same hike twice.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">For those planning their first visit, remember that preparation enhances enjoyment.

The 2.5-mile round trip distance includes a manageable 500-foot elevation gain spread over wide, well-maintained paths. Most beginners can complete this hike in 1.5-2 hours, including time for photos and rest stops at scenic viewpoints. The trail's gradual incline and multiple rest areas make it accessible for various fitness levels. I recommend starting early in the morning to avoid crowds and heat, bringing plenty of water, and wearing supportive hiking shoes. The trail's popularity means you'll encounter other hikers who can offer assistance if needed, creating a safe environment for those new to hiking in Los Angeles.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; margin-bottom: 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; padding-bottom: 8px;\">What is the best time of day to hike Mt Hollywood trail?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0; line-height: 1.6;\">The optimal times for hiking the <strong>Mt Hollywood trail</strong> are early morning (sunrise to 9 AM) and late afternoon (2 hours before sunset). Early morning offers cooler temperatures, fewer crowds, clearer air quality, and stunning sunrise opportunities from the summit. Late afternoon provides golden hour photography conditions and spectacular sunset views over the Pacific Ocean on clear days. During summer months, I strongly recommend morning hikes starting before 8 AM to avoid intense heat, as the trail offers minimal shade beyond the initial tree coverage. Winter allows more flexibility with comfortable hiking conditions throughout the day. Weekday mornings are significantly less crowded than weekends, providing a more peaceful experience for contemplation and photography.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; margin-bottom: 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; padding-bottom: 8px;\">Where can I park for the Mt Hollywood trail hike?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0; line-height: 1.6;\">The main parking area is at Griffith Observatory, but availability varies dramatically by time and day. The observatory charges $4-15 per hour depending on the season and demand. Free parking alternatives include the Greek Theatre area (adding about 0.5 miles each way to your hike) and spots along Los Feliz Boulevard, though these require longer walks to the trailhead. For guaranteed parking, arrive before 8 AM on weekdays or consider taking the DASH Observatory shuttle bus from the Vermont/Sunset Metro station. Weekend parking fills quickly, especially during peak seasons and special events. I've found that the most stress-free approach involves planning to arrive at the trailhead very early or budgeting for paid parking as part of the hiking experience.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; margin-bottom: 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; padding-bottom: 8px;\">Can I bring my dog on the Mt Hollywood trail?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0; line-height: 1.6;\">Dogs are welcome on the <strong>Mt Hollywood trail</strong> but must remain leashed at all times according to Griffith Park regulations. The trail is very dog-friendly with several water sources, including a fountain at Dante's View where dogs can drink. Consider your dog's fitness level, as the 2.5-mile distance with elevation gain can be challenging for some pets, especially in hot weather. Bring extra water for your dog, check paw pads regularly on hot pavement near the trailhead, and be prepared to clean up after your pet. The trail's popularity means you'll encounter many other dogs, so ensure your pet is comfortable with social situations. Summer hiking requires special caution for dogs due to hot surfaces and limited shade, making early morning starts essential for their safety and comfort.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; margin-bottom: 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; padding-bottom: 8px;\">What should I bring for hiking Mt Hollywood trail?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0; line-height: 1.6;\">Essential items for the <strong>Mt Hollywood trail</strong> include at least 32 ounces of water per person (more in summer), sunscreen, snacks for energy, and comfortable hiking shoes with good traction. A hat and sunglasses provide crucial sun protection on the exposed sections. I recommend bringing a camera for the spectacular views, a small first aid kit for minor scrapes, and layers for changing weather conditions. Trekking poles can help with stability, though they're not required for this moderately challenging trail. Cell phone service is excellent throughout the hike, but download offline maps as backup. Consider bringing a headlamp for early morning or evening hikes, and always pack out all trash to preserve this beautiful area for future visitors. Quality gear enhances safety and enjoyment significantly.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; margin-bottom: 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; padding-bottom: 8px;\">How long does it take to complete the Mt Hollywood trail?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0; line-height: 1.6;\">Most hikers complete the <strong>Mt Hollywood trail</strong> in 1.5 to 2 hours, including stops for photos and rest at scenic viewpoints. The actual hiking time averages 45-60 minutes each direction for moderately fit individuals, but the summit views deserve extended appreciation time. Factors affecting duration include fitness level, weather conditions, crowd size, and photography interests. Early morning hikes typically move faster due to fewer people and cooler temperatures. Allow extra time during peak seasons when the trail becomes crowded, potentially slowing progress at narrow sections. Sunset hikes require careful timing to ensure safe descent in diminishing light. I recommend planning 2.5-3 hours total for a relaxed experience that includes time to enjoy the incredible panoramic views that make this trail one of Los Angeles' most rewarding short hikes.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n  \"headline\": \"Mt Hollywood Trail: Complete Hiking Guide to LA's Best Views 2024\",\n  \"description\": \"Complete hiking guide to Mt Hollywood Trail featuring personal experiences, gear recommendations, seasonal tips, and everything needed for an unforgettable Los Angeles hiking adventure with spectacular city and Hollywood Sign views.\",\n  \"image\": \"https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mt-hollywood-10-640x427.jpg\",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Person\",\n    \"name\": \"Trail Expert Guide\"\n  },\n  \"publisher\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n    \"name\": \"Explore National Parks\",\n    \"logo\": {\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n      \"url\": \"https://explorenationalparks.store/logo.png\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"datePublished\": \"2024-08-08\",\n  \"dateModified\": \"2024-08-08\",\n  \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n    \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n    \"@id\": \"https://explorenationalparks.store/mt-hollywood-trail\"\n  },\n  \"articleSection\": \"Hiking Guides\",\n  \"keywords\": \"mt hollywood trail, hiking los angeles, griffith park trails, hollywood sign views, la hiking guide\",\n  \"wordCount\": 2847,\n  \"mainEntity\": {\n    \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n    \"mainEntity\": [\n      {\n        \"@type\": \"Question\",\n        \"name\": \"How difficult is the Mt Hollywood trail for beginners?\",\n        \"position\": 1,\n        \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n          \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n          \"text\": \"The Mt Hollywood trail is perfect for beginners who want a rewarding hiking experience without technical challenges.
