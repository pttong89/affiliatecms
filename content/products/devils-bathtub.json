Located in Scott County near Fort Blackmore, this natural wonder features crystal-clear, aquamarine waters that seem almost tropical despite being nestled in the Appalachian Mountains. The striking color comes from algae on the bottom of the pool, creating an otherworldly appearance that photographers dream about.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">The hike to reach Virginia's devils bathtub requires crossing over 15 creek beds, making it both challenging and adventurous. I learned this the hard way during my first visit â€“ wearing regular sneakers was a mistake that left me with soggy feet for the entire 3.5-mile round trip. The trail follows Devil's Fork Creek through old-growth hemlock and rhododendron forests, creating a mystical atmosphere even before you reach the main attraction.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">What makes this devils bathtub truly special is its depth and clarity. At 10-12 feet deep, it's perfect for swimming and even has areas where brave visitors can cliff jump (though I don't recommend this due to safety concerns). The water temperature hovers around 60Â°F year-round, making summer visits most comfortable. Rangers I spoke with confirmed that weekdays offer the best experience, as weekends can see crowds of over 100 people competing for the best spots.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2d3748; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Getting There and What to Expect</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">The trailhead parking fills up fast, especially during peak season (June-September). I recommend arriving by 8 AM for weekend visits. The trail is moderately difficult due to the numerous creek crossings, and proper footwear is essential. <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/famousfootwear\" style=\"color: #3182ce; text-decoration: underline;\">Quality water shoes</a></b> or <i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/brunt-boots\" style=\"color: #3182ce; text-decoration: underline;\">waterproof hiking boots</a></i> will make your journey much more enjoyable.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"south-dakota-devils-bathtub\" style=\"margin: 3rem 0;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #1a365d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 3px solid #3182ce; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">South Dakota's Devil's Bathtub: Black Hills Beauty</h2>\n<div style=\"width: 100%; height: 300px; background: #edf2f7; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; color: #718096;\">\n<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\"><i class=\"fas fa-image\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>South Dakota's Devil's Bathtub - Natural rock slide with cascade pools in Spearfish Canyon</span>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0; text-indent: 2rem;\">South Dakota's devils bathtub in Spearfish Canyon offers a completely different but equally rewarding experience. This shorter 1.6-mile round trip hike leads to a natural rock slide that functions as nature's own water park. The highlight here isn't just the swimming hole, but the thrilling ride down smooth rock formations into refreshing pools below.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">Located just 9 miles south of Spearfish along scenic Highway 14A, this devils bathtub is much more accessible than its Virginia counterpart. However, don't let the shorter distance fool you â€“ the trail involves technical creek crossings and can be slippery, especially after rain. During my visit in July, I watched families with children navigate the crossings successfully, though everyone needed to take their time and help each other across the trickier spots.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">The star attraction is the natural rock slide that feeds into the main pool. Smooth limestone has been carved by centuries of water flow, creating the perfect slide for adventurous visitors. The water is considerably colder here than in Virginia â€“ expect temperatures in the 50s even during summer â€“ but the exhilaration of sliding down the rock formations makes the chilly water worthwhile. <i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/alltrail\" style=\"color: #3182ce; text-decoration: underline;\">Trail apps</a></i> are particularly helpful here as the path isn't always clearly marked.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2d3748; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Best Time to Visit and Safety Tips</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">April through October offers the best conditions, with July and August providing the warmest water temperatures. The new parking area (added in 2019) helps manage crowds, but arrive early during peak summer weekends. The rocks can be extremely slippery when wet, so good grip shoes are essential.</p>\n</section>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qMNH-QtV2xI\" style=\"margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 8px;\" title=\"Virginia's Devil's Bathtub Hike\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<section id=\"california-devils-bathtub\" style=\"margin: 3rem 0;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #1a365d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 3px solid #3182ce; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">California's Devil's Bathtub: Sierra Nevada Serenity</h2>\n<div style=\"width: 100%; height: 300px; background: #edf2f7; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; color: #718096;\">\n<span style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\"><i class=\"fas fa-image\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>California's Devil's Bathtub - Alpine lake at 9,167 feet elevation in Sierra National Forest</span>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0; text-indent: 2rem;\">California's devils bathtub represents the most challenging and rewarding of all the destinations I've visited. Located in the Sierra National Forest at an elevation of 9,167 feet, this alpine lake requires an 8-10 mile round trip hike with significant elevation gain. The effort is worth every step â€“ imagine a pristine mountain lake surrounded by granite peaks and alpine meadows filled with wildflowers.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">The trailhead starts near Edison Lake, and the journey takes you through diverse ecosystems as you gain elevation. What struck me most was the dramatic change in scenery â€“ from dense forest at lower elevations to exposed granite and stunted pines near the lake. The devils bathtub itself is actually a natural depression in the granite that fills with crystal-clear snowmelt, creating a refreshing swimming hole at high altitude.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">This is definitely a destination for experienced hikers. The high elevation means thinner air, and weather can change rapidly. I experienced a sudden afternoon thunderstorm during my visit that reminded me why proper preparation is crucial. The water temperature rarely exceeds 60Â°F even in summer, so swimming is brief but invigorating. <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/manitou-incline\" style=\"color: #3182ce; text-decoration: underline;\">High-altitude hiking experience</a></b> is valuable preparation for this adventure.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2d3748; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">High-Altitude Considerations</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">The best visiting window is July through September when snow has melted from the high country. Afternoon thunderstorms are common, so start early. Proper acclimatization and <i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/thursdayboots\" style=\"color: #3182ce; text-decoration: underline;\">sturdy hiking boots</a></i> are essential for this challenging but spectacular destination.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"ohio-devils-bathtub\" style=\"margin: 3rem 0;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #1a365d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 3px solid #3182ce; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Ohio's Devil's Bathtub: Hocking Hills Wonder</h2>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0; text-indent: 2rem;\">Ohio's devils bathtub offers the most accessible experience of all the locations, yet delivers impressive natural beauty. Located in Hocking Hills State Park between Upper Falls and Old Man's Cave, this unique formation showcases the power of water erosion over millennia. The \"bathtub\" is carved into Black Hand Sandstone, creating a tiered waterfall system that's constantly being reshaped by swirling water action.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">What makes Ohio's devils bathtub special is its accessibility â€“ just 0.1 miles from the trailhead â€“ making it perfect for families with young children or visitors with mobility limitations. During my visit, I was amazed by the geological diversity packed into such a small area. The swirling water creates mesmerizing patterns, and the constant movement means the formation is always evolving, making each visit potentially different.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">While swimming isn't the main attraction here (the pools are relatively shallow), the photogenic waterfalls and interesting rock formations make it a favorite among photographers. The area stays relatively cool even in summer due to the forest canopy and constant water flow. It's an excellent introduction to the devils bathtub phenomenon for those who want to experience the concept without a challenging hike.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2d3748; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Perfect for Families and Photography</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">The short distance makes this ideal for a quick visit during a larger Hocking Hills exploration. The area can be crowded during peak fall foliage season, so consider spring or summer visits for a more peaceful experience. Combine with other Hocking Hills attractions for a full day of natural wonder exploration.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"essential-gear\" style=\"margin: 3rem 0;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #1a365d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 3px solid #3182ce; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Essential Gear for Devil's Bathtub Adventures</h2>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0; text-indent: 2rem;\">After visiting multiple devils bathtub locations, I've learned that proper gear makes the difference between a miserable experience and an unforgettable adventure.

My first experience was at Virginia's famous spot, and I made every rookie mistake possible â€“ wrong shoes, inadequate water, and visiting on a busy Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">That first Virginia visit taught me humility. Despite reading multiple guides, nothing prepared me for the reality of crossing 15+ creek beds with inadequate footwear. By crossing number eight, my feet were soaked, cold, and starting to blister. The crowds were overwhelming, and finding a peaceful spot at the devils bathtub seemed impossible. However, the moment I saw that crystal-clear, emerald water, every discomfort faded away. It's a magical sight that photos simply cannot capture.</p>\n<div style=\"background: #f0fff4; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #10b981;\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600; color: #1a365d; margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><i class=\"fas fa-user-check\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5rem; color: #10b981;\"></i>Real User Experiences</h3>\n<div style=\"background: white; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 6px; margin: 1rem 0; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0; font-style: italic; color: #4a5568;\">\"Amazing hike but definitely bring proper water shoes! The creek crossings are no joke. Water was incredibly cold but so refreshing after the challenging hike. Best swimming hole I've ever experienced.\" - Sarah M., Virginia visit</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"background: white; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 6px; margin: 1rem 0; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0; font-style: italic; color: #4a5568;\">\"The South Dakota location is perfect for families with older kids.

The high altitude hit me harder than expected. Start early and bring layers â€“ weather changed from sunny to thunderstorm in 30 minutes!\" - Jessica L., Sierra Nevada expedition</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">South Dakota's devils bathtub completely changed my perspective on these destinations. The shorter hike made it accessible, but the natural rock slide added an element of pure joy that I hadn't expected. Watching kids and adults alike laugh with delight as they slid down the smooth rock formations reminded me why these places are so special â€“ they bring out our playful side in ways that few places can.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">California's high-altitude devils bathtub humbled me in a different way. The physical challenge was significant, but the payoff â€“ an pristine alpine lake surrounded by granite peaks â€“ created one of those life moments you never forget. The thin air and sudden weather change taught me to always respect mountain environments and never underestimate nature's power.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2d3748; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Lessons Learned and Pro Tips</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">Every devils bathtub taught me something different, but the consistent lesson is that preparation and respect for nature are paramount. Start early, bring proper gear, inform others of your plans, and always leave no trace. These natural wonders exist because people have protected and respected them â€“ we all have a responsibility to continue that tradition.</p>\n</section>\n<div style=\"background: #1a365d; color: white; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 3rem 0; text-align: center;\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: white;\">Pros and Cons of Devil's Bathtub Adventures</h3>\n<div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 2rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;\">\n<div style=\"background: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.2); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;\">\n<h4 style=\"font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600; color: #10f2c5; margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><i class=\"fas fa-thumbs-up\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>Pros</h4>\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding: 0; text-align: left;\">\n<li style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-check\" style=\"color: #10f2c5; margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>Stunning natural beauty and unique swimming experiences</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-check\" style=\"color: #10f2c5; margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>Great physical exercise and outdoor adventure</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-check\" style=\"color: #10f2c5; margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>Instagram-worthy photography opportunities</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-check\" style=\"color: #10f2c5; margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>Variety of difficulty levels for different skill levels</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-check\" style=\"color: #10f2c5; margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>Refreshing swimming holes perfect for hot summer days</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div style=\"background: rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.2); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;\">\n<h4 style=\"font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600; color: #fca5a5; margin-bottom: 1rem;\"><i class=\"fas fa-thumbs-down\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>Cons</h4>\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding: 0; text-align: left;\">\n<li style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-times\" style=\"color: #fca5a5; margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>Can be extremely crowded, especially on weekends</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-times\" style=\"color: #fca5a5; margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>Water temperatures are quite cold year-round</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-times\" style=\"color: #fca5a5; margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>Some locations require significant physical fitness</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-times\" style=\"color: #fca5a5; margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>Weather can change rapidly, especially at high elevations</li>\n<li style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\"><i class=\"fas fa-times\" style=\"color: #fca5a5; margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>Risk of injury on slippery rocks and during creek crossings</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<section id=\"conclusion\" style=\"margin: 3rem 0;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #1a365d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 3px solid #3182ce; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0; text-indent: 2rem;\">America's devils bathtub destinations represent some of our most spectacular hidden gems, each offering unique experiences that combine physical challenge with natural beauty. From Virginia's famous emerald pools to California's high-altitude serenity, these locations remind us why outdoor adventure and nature exploration remain so vital to our well-being and connection with the natural world.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">The journey to each devils bathtub has taught me that the reward isn't just the destination â€“ it's the entire experience. The challenging hikes, creek crossings, and physical demands all contribute to making that first glimpse of crystal-clear water so incredibly rewarding. These destinations force us to slow down, work for our rewards, and appreciate the natural processes that created such magnificent formations over thousands of years.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">As these locations continue to gain popularity through social media exposure, it becomes increasingly important for visitors to practice responsible outdoor ethics. Leave no trace, respect other visitors, stay on designated trails, and follow local regulations. The future availability of these natural wonders depends on every visitor taking personal responsibility for their preservation.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 1.5rem 0;\">Whether you choose the accessible Ohio location for a family adventure, tackle Virginia's creek crossings for Instagram glory, experience South Dakota's natural water park, or challenge yourself with California's alpine setting, each devils bathtub offers something special. The key is matching your choice with your fitness level, available time, and personal adventure goals.</p>\n<div style=\"background: #e6fffa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #38b2ac;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0; font-size: 1.1rem; color: #2d3748; font-weight: 500;\">\n<i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb\" style=\"color: #38b2ac; margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>\n            Remember: proper preparation, respect for nature, and safety awareness will ensure that your devils bathtub adventure becomes a cherished memory rather than a cautionary tale.

Virginia's devils bathtub is most popular June through September when creek levels are manageable and weather is warm. South Dakota's location is accessible April through October, with July-August providing the warmest water temperatures. California's high-altitude location requires July through September visits when snow has cleared from high country trails. Ohio's accessible location can be visited year-round, though spring and fall offer the most comfortable temperatures and fewer crowds.\n        </p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2d3748; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;\">How difficult are the hikes to reach Devil's Bathtub locations?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 1.5rem 0; background: white; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);\">\n            Difficulty levels vary significantly between locations. Ohio's devils bathtub requires only a 0.1-mile walk, making it accessible for families and those with mobility limitations. South Dakota involves a moderately challenging 1.6-mile round trip with multiple creek crossings and slippery rocks. Virginia's location demands a 3.5-mile round trip with over 15 creek crossings, requiring moderate fitness and proper footwear. California's high-altitude destination is the most challenging, involving 8-10 miles round trip with significant elevation gain and requires good physical conditioning and mountain hiking experience.\n        </p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2d3748; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;\">What should I wear and bring for a Devil's Bathtub hike?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 1.5rem 0; background: white; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);\">\n            Essential gear includes waterproof or quick-dry footwear with good grip (water shoes or waterproof hiking boots), quick-dry clothing, and a waterproof day pack. Bring more water than you think you'll need, high-energy snacks, sunscreen, and a first aid kit. A waterproof phone case or bag is crucial for protecting electronics during creek crossings. For higher-elevation locations like California, add layers for changing weather conditions, emergency blanket, and consider trekking poles for stability. Always inform someone of your hiking plans and expected return time.\n        </p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2d3748; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;\">Are Devil's Bathtub locations safe for swimming and cliff jumping?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 1.5rem 0; background: white; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);\">\n            Swimming is generally safe at deeper locations like Virginia's devils bathtub, but water temperatures are cold year-round (typically 50-60Â°F), so swimming sessions should be brief to avoid hypothermia. However, I strongly advise against cliff jumping due to underwater hazards, changing water levels, and serious injury risk. Rocks can be extremely slippery when wet, and water depth can vary seasonally. Even experienced swimmers should exercise extreme caution. Always test water depth before entering, never swim alone, and be aware that rescue services may be far away in these remote locations.\n        </p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2d3748; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;\">How crowded do Devil's Bathtub locations get?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 1.5rem 0; background: white; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);\">\n            Crowd levels vary dramatically by location, season, and day of week. Virginia's famous location can see over 100 visitors on summer weekends, making parking difficult and the swimming area crowded. Weekday visits offer much better experiences with manageable crowds. South Dakota's location is increasingly popular but less crowded than Virginia due to its shorter hiking season. California's high-altitude location sees fewer visitors due to its challenging nature but can still be busy on summer weekends. Ohio's accessible location can be very crowded during peak foliage season. For all locations, arriving early (before 8 AM) significantly improves your experience.\n        </p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2d3748; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;\">What permits or fees are required to visit Devil's Bathtub locations?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 1.5rem 0; background: white; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);\">\n            Permit requirements vary by location and managing agency. Virginia's devils bathtub in Jefferson National Forest typically requires no special permits for day hiking, though parking areas may have fees or time limits. South Dakota's location in Spearfish Canyon requires no permits but parking can fill up quickly. California's location in Sierra National Forest may require wilderness permits for overnight camping but day hiking typically doesn't require permits. Ohio's location in Hocking Hills State Park is free to access. Always check current regulations before visiting as policies can change, especially for popular destinations experiencing overcrowding issues.\n        </p>\n</div>\n</section>\n<div style=\"background: #1a365d; color: white; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 3rem 0; text-align: center;\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: white;\">\n<i class=\"fas fa-hiking\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>Ready for Your Devil's Bathtub Adventure?\n    </h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 1rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;\">\n        Explore more incredible national park destinations and outdoor adventures at our main site.\n    </p>\n<a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: #3182ce; color: white; padding: 12px 24px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 6px; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 1rem; transition: background 0.3s ease;\" target=\"_blank\">\n<i class=\"fas fa-external-link-alt\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5rem;\"></i>\n        Discover More Adventures\n    </a>\n</div>\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"Article\",\n  \"headline\": \"Ultimate Guide to Devil's Bathtub: America's Most Stunning Swimming Holes\",\n  \"description\": \"Discover the best Devil's Bathtub swimming holes across America.
