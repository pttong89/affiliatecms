The lot holds about 200 cars, but by 8 AM on any decent weather day, you'll be circling like a vulture. I've arrived at 7 AM on Saturdays and still struggled to find a spot. My advice? Arrive by 6:30 AM or consider weekday hikes.\n                </p>\n                \n                <p class=\"mb-6\">\n                    The good news is that King County Metro's Trailhead Direct bus service runs on weekends during hiking season, connecting Seattle to Mount Si.

You'll climb steadily through dense Pacific Northwest forest, with towering Douglas firs and western hemlocks creating a cathedral-like canopy. The trail is well-maintained but can be muddy during Washington's wet months (October through May).\n                </p>\n                \n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-700 mb-4\">Snag Flat: Ancient Forest Marvel</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    Around mile 1.5, you'll reach Snag Flat, home to some of the most impressive old-growth trees on the trail.

You'll catch your first glimpses of the Snoqualmie Valley through breaks in the canopy.

Mount Rainier dominates the southern horizon, while the Olympic Mountains stretch across the west.

This is where many hikers make a crucial decision. The scramble to the Haystack is technical Class 3-4 terrain with serious exposure. Unless you have rock climbing experience and proper gear, stick to the meadow views. I've seen too many rescue helicopters on this mountain to recommend the scramble casually.\n                </p>\n                \n                <div class=\"bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-red-200\">\n                    <h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-red-800 mb-3\">\n                        <i class=\"fas fa-exclamation-triangle text-red-600 mr-2\"></i>Safety Warning\n                    </h3>\n                    <p class=\"text-red-800\">The Haystack scramble has resulted in multiple fatalities and numerous rescues.

While the trail is well-maintained with consistent switchbacks, the sustained uphill climb can be challenging. I recommend beginners start with shorter hikes first, but with proper preparation and pacing, many first-time hikers successfully complete Mount Si. Consider starting with easier trails like <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/mount-major\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:underline\"><b>Mount Major</b></a> before attempting this peak.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <div class=\"bg-white border rounded-lg shadow-sm\">\n                        <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 p-4 bg-gray-50 rounded-t-lg border-b\">\n                            What time should I start hiking Mount Si?\n                        </h3>\n                        <div class=\"p-4\">\n                            <p class=\"text-gray-700\">\n                                I always recommend starting before 7 AM, especially on weekends and during summer months. The parking lot fills up quickly by 8-9 AM, and you'll avoid crowds on the trail. Early starts also mean cooler temperatures and better chances of clear summit views before afternoon clouds roll in. Unlike some peaks where timing is flexible, Mount Si's popularity makes early starts essential for a quality experience.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <div class=\"bg-white border rounded-lg shadow-sm\">\n                        <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 p-4 bg-gray-50 rounded-t-lg border-b\">\n                            Can I hike Mount Si in winter?\n                        </h3>\n                        <div class=\"p-4\">\n                            <p class=\"text-gray-700\">\n                                Yes, but winter hiking on Mount Si requires proper preparation. From November through March, expect snow and icy conditions. Microspikes or snowshoes are essential, along with layers for temperature regulation. I've hiked it in winter several times, and while beautiful, the trail becomes much more challenging and potentially dangerous without proper gear.

It's a technical Class 3-4 scramble with serious exposure. Many injuries occur here annually. If you don't have scrambling experience or aren't comfortable with steep, exposed terrain, enjoy the views from the meadow instead.

In my experience, trekking poles are invaluable for the descent. Always check weather conditions and pack rain gear, even on sunny days, as mountain weather changes quickly.
