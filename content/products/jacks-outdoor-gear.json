What started as a modest operation grew into something much more significant when their son, Jim Quinlan, recognized the potential to expand westward into Colorado's outdoor recreation market. In 1983, Jim moved to Fort Collins and opened Rocky Mountain Surplus, which eventually evolved into the JAX Outdoor Gear we know today.</p>\n\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">This family legacy represents more than just business success—it embodies a genuine passion for outdoor adventure that permeates every aspect of JAX's operations. During my conversations with long-time employees, I've learned that this commitment to outdoor recreation isn't just marketing speak. The Quinlan family and their staff are genuine outdoor enthusiasts who understand that quality gear can mean the difference between a memorable adventure and a dangerous situation.</p>\n\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">The transition from military surplus to comprehensive <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/outdoor-gear\" style=\"color: #2d5a27;\"><i>outdoor gear</i></a> retailer reflects Colorado's outdoor culture evolution. As recreational activities like rock climbing, backcountry skiing, and technical hiking gained popularity, JAX adapted their inventory and expertise to meet these growing demands. Today, they maintain that original surplus store character while offering cutting-edge outdoor technology and equipment.</p>\n\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">What impresses me most about JAX's history is their commitment to community involvement. They've sponsored countless local outdoor events, supported search and rescue operations, and provided gear donations to outdoor education programs. This community focus has created a loyal customer base that spans multiple generations—I regularly see families shopping together, with grandparents, parents, and children all getting outfitted for their adventures.</p>\n\n        <div style=\"background: #e8f5e8; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #2d5a27;\">\n            <p style=\"margin: 0; font-style: italic;\"><strong>Insider Tip:</strong> Ask about the \"JAX Family\" discount program when you visit. Long-time customers often receive special pricing on seasonal gear, and the staff genuinely remembers your previous purchases and outdoor interests.</p>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"locations\" style=\"margin-bottom: 3rem;\">\n        <h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2d5a27; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 2px solid #2d5a27; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Store Locations and What Makes Each Special</h2>\n        \n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">Understanding the unique character of each <strong>jacks outdoor gear</strong> location helps you choose the best store for your specific needs. After visiting all Colorado locations multiple times, I've discovered that each has developed its own personality and specializations based on local outdoor recreation patterns.</p>\n\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; color: #2d5a27; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 2rem;\">Fort Collins - The Flagship Experience</h3>\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">Located at 1200 N College Avenue, the Fort Collins location serves as JAX's flagship store and offers the most comprehensive selection. This 21,000+ square foot facility houses everything from technical climbing gear to farm equipment. The climbing section here is particularly impressive, with knowledgeable staff who regularly climb at local crags like Horsetooth Rock and Eldorado Canyon.</p>\n\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">I've found the Fort Collins store excels in several areas: their boot fitting service is exceptional (they have a proper Brannock device and take the time for proper measurements), their camping gear selection rivals specialty outdoor retailers, and their <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/outdoor-hiking-gear\" style=\"color: #2d5a27;\"><b>outdoor hiking gear</b></a> section includes hard-to-find items like ultralight backpacking equipment and technical mountaineering gear.</p>\n\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; color: #2d5a27; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 2rem;\">Loveland - The Local Favorite</h3>\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">The Loveland location has developed a strong reputation among locals for its fishing and hunting expertise. Staff here include several licensed fishing guides who provide invaluable advice about local conditions, seasonal patterns, and gear recommendations. Their fly fishing selection is particularly comprehensive, including locally-tied flies that work exceptionally well in Colorado waters.</p>\n\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; color: #2d5a27; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 2rem;\">Lafayette and Broomfield - Growing Communities</h3>\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">These newer locations focus on serving growing suburban communities with families getting into outdoor recreation. Both stores excel in entry-level gear recommendations and family camping equipment.

Unlike general sporting goods stores that focus on mainstream brands, JAX curates their inventory based on performance in Colorado's challenging conditions—from intense UV exposure at altitude to sudden weather changes and extreme temperature variations.</p>\n\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; color: #2d5a27; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 2rem;\">Camping and Backpacking Equipment</h3>\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">JAX's camping section impresses me most with their range of <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/outdoor-adventure-gear\" style=\"color: #2d5a27;\"><i>outdoor adventure gear</i></a> suitable for everything from car camping to technical mountaineering. They stock quality tents from Big Agnes (a Colorado company), MSR, and REI Co-op, but also carry budget-friendly options that don't compromise on essential features like waterproofing and wind resistance.</p>\n\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">Their sleeping bag selection particularly stands out. Staff can help you navigate the confusing world of temperature ratings, fill types, and sizing. I've purchased three sleeping bags from JAX over the years, and their advice has never steered me wrong. They understand that Colorado camping often means large temperature swings—what might be 70°F during the day can drop to 30°F at night, even in summer.</p>\n\n        <a href=\"https://amazon.com/dp/B077XQDZW4/?tag=natureguests00-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: #ff9900; color: white; padding: 12px 24px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 6px; margin: 1rem 0; font-weight: bold; transition: background-color 0.3s;\">\n            <i class=\"fas fa-shopping-cart\"></i> Shop Quality Sleeping Bags on Amazon\n        </a>\n\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; color: #2d5a27; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 2rem;\">Footwear and Apparel Expertise</h3>\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">JAX's footwear selection and fitting expertise deserves special mention. They carry all major hiking boot brands but focus on models that perform well on Colorado's varied terrain. Their staff understands the difference between boots needed for technical alpine routes versus day hiking on maintained trails. More importantly, they take time for proper fitting—something increasingly rare in outdoor retail.</p>\n\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">The apparel selection emphasizes layering systems appropriate for Colorado's climate. They stock quality <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/outdoor-winter-gear\" style=\"color: #2d5a27;\"><b>outdoor winter gear</b></a> from brands like Patagonia, Arc'teryx, and local Colorado companies. Their staff can explain the practical differences between different insulation types and help you build a versatile layering system rather than pushing expensive single-purpose items.</p>\n\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; color: #2d5a27; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 2rem;\">Hunting and Fishing Specialization</h3>\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">JAX's hunting and fishing departments set them apart from general outdoor retailers. Their fishing section includes extensive fly fishing supplies with local expertise—staff can recommend specific fly patterns for different Colorado waters and seasons. They also provide rod repair services and can help you understand complex fishing regulations across different Colorado counties and federal lands.</p>\n\n        <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKLxv0trWZQ\" title=\"The Gear You WANT vs The Gear You NEED\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;\"></iframe>\n\n        <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;\">\n            <a href=\"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CW9R1Y4R/?tag=natureguests00-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: #28a745; color: white; padding: 15px 30px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 8px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1rem; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); transition: all 0.3s;\">\n                <i class=\"fas fa-backpack\"></i> Find Quality Hiking Backpacks on Amazon\n            </a>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"personal-experience\" style=\"margin-bottom: 3rem;\">\n        <h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2d5a27; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 2px solid #2d5a27; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">My Personal Experience with JAX Outdoor Gear</h2>\n        \n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">My relationship with <strong>jacks outdoor gear</strong> began in 2018 when I moved to Fort Collins and needed to replace gear damaged during my cross-country move. Walking into the Fort Collins location felt like entering an outdoor enthusiast's paradise—the smell of leather boots, the sight of quality gear organized by passionate experts, and the immediate availability of knowledgeable staff who genuinely wanted to help rather than just make a sale.</p>\n\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; color: #2d5a27; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 2rem;\">First Purchase: Hiking Boots That Changed Everything</h3>\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">My first major purchase was a pair of Oboz Bridger Mid waterproof boots. The staff member, Sarah, spent nearly an hour helping me understand the differences between various brands and models. She explained how Colorado's rocky terrain demands good ankle support, how altitude affects foot swelling, and why waterproofing matters even in our relatively dry climate (sudden afternoon thunderstorms!).</p>\n\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">Those boots have now accompanied me on over 200 Colorado hikes, including technical scrambles up fourteeners, multi-day backpacking trips in the Maroon Bells Wilderness, and countless Front Range adventures. Four years later, they're still performing excellently—a testament to both the quality gear JAX stocks and their expert fitting advice.</p>\n\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; color: #2d5a27; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 2rem;\">Winter Gear Consultation and Expert Advice</h3>\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">My most valuable JAX experience came when preparing for my first Colorado winter backcountry trip. I needed to upgrade from my basic three-season gear to equipment capable of handling serious winter conditions. The staff didn't just sell me expensive gear—they educated me about layering systems, avalanche safety, and emergency preparedness.</p>\n\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">They recommended a specific combination of <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/outdoor-rain-gear\" style=\"color: #2d5a27;\"><i>outdoor rain gear</i></a> and insulation layers that kept me comfortable during a February snowshoe camping trip where temperatures dropped to -15°F. More importantly, they emphasized safety equipment and knowledge, directing me to avalanche courses and emergency preparedness training that proved invaluable.</p>\n\n        <img src=\"https://exploringwild.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/tent-on-backpack-Colorado-Trail.jpg\" alt=\"Hiking tent properly attached to backpack on Colorado Trail showing proper gear attachment techniques for backpacking adventures\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 700px; height: 350px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem auto; display: block; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\">\n\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; color: #2d5a27; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 2rem;\">Lessons Learned and Ongoing Relationship</h3>\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">Over six years of shopping at JAX, I've learned that their value extends far beyond product sales.

Several customers noted that popular items sell out quickly during hunting season or before major holiday weekends. This reflects JAX's popularity but can frustrate customers who need specific items for planned trips.</p>\n\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">Some customers expressed desire for expanded hours during peak seasons and more extensive online inventory visibility. While JAX maintains an online presence, their strength remains in-person consultation and service—a model that works well for their target customers but may not serve all shopping preferences.</p>\n\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; color: #2d5a27; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 2rem;\">Community Impact and Local Support</h3>\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">JAX's community involvement consistently receives praise from customers and local organizations.

Black Friday and their anniversary sales in late spring provide excellent opportunities for significant savings. I've found that shopping mid-week during off-peak hours also gives you better access to staff expertise and sometimes leads to discovering clearance items that aren't heavily advertised. Sign up for their newsletter to get advance notice of sales and exclusive offers, as inventory moves quickly during major sales events.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 2rem;\">\n            <p style=\"color: #666; font-style: italic;\">For more outdoor adventure guides and gear recommendations, explore our comprehensive collection at <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/outdoor-gear-revival\" style=\"color: #2d5a27;\"><b>outdoor gear revival</b></a>, <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/darche-outdoor-gear\" style=\"color: #2d5a27;\"><i>darche outdoor gear</i></a>, <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/farpointe-outdoor-gear\" style=\"color: #2d5a27;\"><b>farpointe outdoor gear</b></a>, <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/foxelli-outdoor-gear\" style=\"color: #2d5a27;\"><i>foxelli outdoor gear</i></a>, <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/fuel-outdoor-gear\" style=\"color: #2d5a27;\"><b>fuel outdoor gear</b></a>, <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/moosejaw-outdoor-gear\" style=\"color: #2d5a27;\"><i>moosejaw outdoor gear</i></a>, <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/pathfinder-outdoor-gear\" style=\"color: #2d5a27;\"><b>pathfinder outdoor gear</b></a>, and <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/rab-outdoor-gear\" style=\"color: #2d5a27;\"><i>rab outdoor gear</i></a>.</p>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n</article>\n\n<footer style=\"background: #2d5a27; color: white; text-align: center; padding: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem;\">\n    <p style=\"margin: 0; font-size: 0.9rem;\">© 2025 Explore National Parks.
