Located on the Makah Reservation in the far northwest corner of Washington State, this trail provides access to the northwesternmost point of the contiguous United States—a geographic distinction that adds an element of adventure to an already stunning hike.</p>\n\n    <p>What sets Cape Flattery apart from other coastal trails isn't just its unique geographical significance, but the remarkable diversity of experiences packed into such a short distance. The trail begins in a mystical old-growth forest dominated by massive Sitka spruce trees draped in moss, creating an almost otherworldly atmosphere that reminds me of scenes from fairy tales.</p>\n\n    <div style=\"background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #4a7c59; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 5px;\">\n        <h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; margin-top: 0;\">Quick Trail Stats</h3>\n        <ul style=\"margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;\">\n            <li><strong>Distance:</strong> 1.5 miles roundtrip (0.75 miles each way)</li>\n            <li><strong>Elevation Change:</strong> 229 feet descent to viewpoints</li>\n            <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy (suitable for most fitness levels)</li>\n            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 30-60 minutes hiking, 1-2 hours total with viewpoint time</li>\n            <li><strong>Trail Type:</strong> Combination of dirt path, wooden boardwalks, and stairs</li>\n            <li><strong>Best Time:</strong> Year-round, sunrise/sunset for best photography</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <p>The trail's manageable length makes it accessible to hikers of virtually all ages and abilities, yet the payoff is absolutely spectacular. I've hiked trails ten times longer that didn't provide half the visual impact of Cape Flattery's dramatic finale. The four observation platforms at the end offer different perspectives of the rugged coastline, each revealing new details of this wild and pristine landscape.</p>\n\n    <p>What makes Cape Flattery particularly special is its cultural significance. This isn't just another pretty trail—it's a window into the rich heritage of the Makah people, who have called this region home for thousands of years. The trail is impeccably maintained by the Makah Tribe, and their stewardship shows in every boardwalk plank and interpretive sign along the way.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"permits\">\n    <h2 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.8em; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 2px solid #4a7c59; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Permits &amp; Getting There</h2>\n\n    <p>One of the most important things to understand before visiting Cape Flattery is the permit requirement. Since the trail is located entirely on Makah Reservation land, all visitors must purchase a Makah Recreation Permit before accessing the area. This requirement supports the tribe's conservation efforts and helps maintain the trail's excellent condition.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Makah Recreation Permit Details</h3>\n\n    <p>The Makah Recreation Permit costs $20 and is valid for one full calendar year from the date of purchase, making it an excellent value if you plan to visit multiple times or explore other areas on the reservation like <b><i>Shi Shi Beach</i></b>. You can purchase permits at several locations in Neah Bay:</p>\n\n    <ul style=\"margin: 15px 0; padding-left: 25px;\">\n        <li>Makah Marina (most convenient, usually open longer hours)</li>\n        <li>Makah Cultural and Research Center Museum</li>\n        <li>Makah Tribal Center</li>\n        <li>Washburn's General Store</li>\n        <li>During summer months, there's often a checkpoint booth at the beginning of Cape Loop Road</li>\n        <li>Online at makah.com (requires printer access for paper permit)</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>I strongly recommend purchasing your permit in Neah Bay rather than relying on the online option, as you'll receive a helpful map showing all accessible areas on the reservation. The staff at these locations are also incredibly knowledgeable about current trail conditions and can provide valuable local insights.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Driving Directions &amp; What to Expect</h3>\n\n    <p>The journey to Cape Flattery is an adventure in itself, requiring about 4.5 hours of driving from Seattle through some of Washington's most spectacular scenery. From Highway 101, you'll turn north onto Highway 112—a winding, sometimes narrow road that follows the northern edge of the Olympic Peninsula.</p>\n\n    <p>The 44-mile drive from Highway 101 to Neah Bay can be challenging, especially during winter months. The road is often under construction, occasionally reduced to single lanes, and features numerous hairpin turns with steep drop-offs. However, the coastal scenery along this route is absolutely breathtaking, with frequent pull-outs offering stunning views of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.</p>\n\n    <div style=\"background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border: 1px solid #ffeaa7; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n        <p style=\"margin: 0; color: #856404;\"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Fill up your gas tank before leaving Highway 101. There are limited fuel options in Neah Bay, and you don't want to be caught short on this remote stretch of coast.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <p>Once you reach Neah Bay, follow the signs toward Cape Flattery, which will take you through town on Bay View Avenue. The road eventually becomes Cape Flattery Road and then Cape Loop Road as you approach the trailhead. The final 8 miles from Neah Bay to the trailhead are well-marked with signs, and the road is paved the entire way.</p>\n\n    <p>Parking at the Cape Flattery trailhead can fill up quickly, especially on weekends and during peak summer months. The lot accommodates about 30-40 vehicles, including some RV spaces. If the main lot is full, there's limited roadside parking along Cape Loop Road, but be extremely careful not to block any access roads or create traffic hazards.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"hiking\">\n    <h2 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.8em; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 2px solid #4a7c59; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Hiking the Cape Flattery Trail</h2>\n\n    <img src=\"https://wereintherockies.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Olympic-Cape-Flattery-Boardwalk-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Wooden boardwalk winding through temperate rainforest on Cape Flattery Trail with moss-covered trees\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 350px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);\">\n\n    <p>The Cape Flattery Trail begins immediately behind the restroom facilities at the trailhead parking area. You'll notice a large, decorative blue chair with \"Neah Bay, WA\" across the back—this makes for a great photo opportunity either before or after your hike, and I always recommend getting a shot here to commemorate your visit to the northwestern tip of the United States.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Through the Enchanted Forest</h3>\n\n    <p>The first portion of the trail descends gradually through what can only be described as an enchanted temperate rainforest. Massive Sitka spruce trees, some hundreds of years old, tower overhead while their trunks and branches are draped in thick, verdant moss. The forest floor is carpeted with ferns, and the overall atmosphere feels almost primordial—like stepping back in time to an ancient world.</p>\n\n    <p>This section of trail is primarily dirt and gravel, well-maintained but can be muddy during Washington's frequent rainy periods. The descent is gentle but noticeable, dropping about 200 feet over the course of the hike. What makes this forest particularly magical is how the canopy filters the light, creating an ever-changing play of shadows and illumination that photographer's dream about.</p>\n\n    <p>About halfway through the forest section, you'll encounter the first of several wooden boardwalks. These boardwalks serve a crucial purpose, protecting both hikers and the fragile forest ecosystem from the mud and standing water that's common in this incredibly wet climate. The Olympic Peninsula receives over 100 inches of annual rainfall, and Cape Flattery gets its full share.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Approaching the Coast</h3>\n\n    <p>As you progress along the trail, you'll begin to hear the sound of waves crashing against the cliffs below—a constant, rhythmic roar that grows louder as you approach your destination. The forest gradually begins to open up, and you'll catch your first glimpses of the Pacific Ocean through gaps in the trees. These preview moments always fill me with anticipation for the spectacular views that lie ahead.</p>\n\n    <p>The boardwalks become more frequent and longer in this section, often elevated several feet above the marshy ground. During my visits, I've noticed how these boardwalks have allowed the natural vegetation to recover and thrive underneath, creating a living tunnel of green that frames your approach to the coast.</p>\n\n    <p>Signs along the trail remind hikers to stay on the designated path—a crucial request that helps preserve the fragile ecosystem. With thousands of visitors each year, even small deviations from the trail can create lasting damage to the pristine environment that the Makah Tribe works so hard to protect.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">The Spectacular Finale: Four Viewing Platforms</h3>\n\n    <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jBVJK4Rk0g8\" title=\"Complete Guide to Visit Cape Flattery in Washington State, Furthest Northwest Tip of the US!\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n    <p>The trail culminates at a series of four strategically positioned viewing platforms, each offering a unique perspective of Cape Flattery's dramatic coastline. These platforms are connected by wooden staircases and shorter boardwalk sections, all constructed with safety railings and built to handle the harsh coastal environment.</p>\n\n    <p>The first platform provides sweeping views to the south, showcasing the rugged cliffs and sea stacks that define this stretch of coastline. On clear days, you can see for miles down the Olympic Peninsula coast, watching waves crash against countless rocky outcrops in an endless display of nature's power.</p>\n\n    <p>The second viewing platform offers the most intimate experience with the sea caves and rock formations directly below Cape Flattery. From this vantage point, you can often spot colorful sea stars clinging to the rocks, and the turquoise pools formed by tidal action are particularly beautiful. I've spent hours at this platform just watching the interplay of light and water in these natural tide pools.</p>\n\n    <p>The third and fourth platforms provide the trail's grand finale—an unobstructed view west toward Tatoosh Island and the open Pacific Ocean. Tatoosh Island, sitting about half a mile offshore, is home to an automated lighthouse that has been guiding ships safely through these treacherous waters since 1857. The island was once a seasonal home for Makah families and later housed lighthouse keepers, but today it's primarily used for scientific research and remains one of the most studied marine environments in the world.</p>\n\n    <img src=\"https://wereintherockies.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC02184.jpeg\" alt=\"Tatoosh Island lighthouse visible from Cape Flattery viewing platform with Pacific Ocean waves\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 350px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);\">\n\n    <p>From these western-facing platforms, you're literally standing at the northwestern-most point of the contiguous United States. On exceptionally clear days, you can see the outline of Vancouver Island, Canada, across the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The realization that you're as far northwest as you can get in the lower 48 states adds a special significance to the already spectacular scenery.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"experience\">\n    <h2 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.8em; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 2px solid #4a7c59; padding-bottom: 10px;\">My Personal Experience</h2>\n\n    <p>I first discovered the Cape Flattery Trail five years ago during a solo backpacking trip around the Olympic Peninsula, and it has since become one of my most-visited destinations in Washington State. Each of my seven visits has revealed something new about this remarkable place, from different lighting conditions that transform the scenery to wildlife encounters that have left me in awe of the Pacific Northwest's natural abundance.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Sunrise Magic and Golden Hour Glory</h3>\n\n    <p>My most memorable Cape Flattery experience occurred during an early October visit when I arrived at the trailhead just before sunrise. The forest was shrouded in mist, and the boardwalks were slick with dew, creating an almost mystical atmosphere as I made my way through the darkness using my headlamp. When I reached the western viewing platform just as the first rays of sunlight broke over the Olympic Mountains behind me, the entire scene transformed into something truly magical.</p>\n\n    <p>The lighthouse on Tatoosh Island was perfectly illuminated by the golden morning light, and the waves below took on an ethereal quality as they caught and reflected the early sunshine. I spent nearly two hours at the platforms that morning, watching as the light slowly revealed more and more details of the coastline, and I had the entire place to myself—a rare treat that made the early wake-up call absolutely worthwhile.</p>\n\n    <p>Sunset visits have been equally spectacular, though typically more crowded. The western orientation of the viewing platforms makes Cape Flattery an ideal location for sunset photography, especially during the summer months when the sun sets far to the northwest. I've learned that arriving about an hour before sunset gives you time to explore all the platforms and find your ideal viewing spot before the main event begins.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Wildlife Encounters and Seasonal Observations</h3>\n\n    <p>Cape Flattery has provided me with some of my most thrilling wildlife encounters in the Pacific Northwest. During a spring visit, I was fortunate enough to witness a pod of gray whales migrating north just offshore from Tatoosh Island. The whales were close enough that I could see their distinctive mottled gray coloring and watch their breathing patterns as they surfaced and dove in the deep waters beyond the cape.</p>\n\n    <p>Bald eagles are regular visitors to the area, and I've observed them fishing in the turbulent waters below the cliffs and nesting in the tall Sitka spruces along the trail. The contrast between these majestic birds and the rugged coastal environment never fails to impress me. During one memorable visit, I watched an eagle successfully catch a salmon from the churning waters below—a display of natural hunting prowess that left me speechless.</p>\n\n    <p>The tidal pools visible from the viewing platforms have revealed a fascinating world of marine life during my various visits. Depending on the tide level and season, I've been able to spot bright orange and purple sea stars, clusters of mussels, and various species of anemones clinging to the rocky surfaces. Binoculars are essential for getting a good look at these creatures from the elevated platforms.</p>\n\n    <div style=\"background: #e8f5e8; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 5px solid #4a7c59;\">\n        <h4 style=\"color: #2c5530; margin-top: 0;\">Local Ranger's Advice</h4>\n        <p style=\"margin: 0;\">During my visits, I've had several conversations with Makah tribal rangers who patrol the area. They consistently emphasize the importance of respecting the natural environment and staying on designated trails. One ranger shared that the biggest threat to the area's ecosystem comes from well-meaning visitors who venture off-trail trying to get closer to the cliff edges for better photos. The vegetation here is incredibly fragile and can take decades to recover from trampling.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Weather Challenges and Rewards</h3>\n\n    <p>Not all of my Cape Flattery visits have been blessed with perfect weather, and some of my most memorable experiences have actually occurred during challenging conditions. A visit during a winter storm provided a completely different perspective on the cape's wild nature. The waves below were enormous, crashing against the cliffs with tremendous force, and the wind was so strong I had to hold onto the platform railings to maintain my balance.</p>\n\n    <p>While the visibility was limited due to driving rain and fog, witnessing the raw power of the Pacific Ocean during a storm gave me a profound appreciation for the forces that shaped this dramatic coastline. The lighthouse on Tatoosh Island appeared and disappeared in the shifting fog like something from a maritime ghost story, and I gained a new understanding of why this area has been so crucial for navigation safety over the past century and a half.</p>\n\n    <p>These challenging weather experiences taught me valuable lessons about gear selection and safety planning. The exposed nature of the viewing platforms means that weather conditions can change rapidly, and being prepared for rain, wind, and temperature drops is essential for a safe and enjoyable visit regardless of the season.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"gear\">\n    <h2 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.8em; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 2px solid #4a7c59; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Essential Gear &amp; What to Bring</h2>\n\n    <p>While the Cape Flattery Trail might be short and relatively easy, the coastal Pacific Northwest environment presents unique challenges that require thoughtful gear selection. The region's reputation for rain is well-deserved, and the exposed nature of the viewing platforms means you'll want to be prepared for rapidly changing weather conditions regardless of the forecast.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Footwear and Clothing Essentials</h3>\n\n    <p>Proper footwear is absolutely critical for the Cape Flattery Trail. The combination of muddy forest paths, potentially slippery boardwalks, and wet coastal conditions means you need shoes that can handle it all. I recommend waterproof hiking boots with good tread—they'll keep your feet dry and provide the traction you need on wet wooden surfaces.</p>\n\n    <div style=\"background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0; border: 1px solid #dee2e6;\">\n        <h4 style=\"color: #2c5530; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><i class=\"fas fa-hiking\" style=\"color: #4a7c59;\"></i> Recommended Hiking Boots</h4>\n        <div style=\"display: flex; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; background: white; border-radius: 5px;\">\n            <div style=\"flex: 1;\">\n                <h5 style=\"margin: 0; color: #2c5530;\"><a href=\"https://amazon.com/dp/B0987YZ647?tag=natureguests00-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #4a7c59;\">Merrell Men's Moab 3 Mid Waterproof Hiking Boot</a></h5>\n                <p style=\"margin: 5px 0; font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;\">Perfect for Cape Flattery's muddy trails and wet conditions.

Most hikers complete the trail in 30-60 minutes, though you'll want to spend time at the viewpoints taking in the spectacular ocean views and looking for wildlife. The return journey involves a gradual uphill climb that most people find manageable, though it can be more challenging in wet or muddy conditions.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Do I need a permit for Cape Flattery Trail?</h3>\n    <p>Yes, you need a Makah Recreation Permit to hike the Cape Flattery Trail since it's located on Makah Reservation land. The permit costs $20 and is valid for one year from the purchase date. You can purchase permits at various locations in Neah Bay including the Makah Marina, Cultural Center Museum, or online at makah.com. The permit also grants access to other reservation attractions like <b><i>Shi Shi Beach</i></b>, making it an excellent value for exploring the area.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">What's the best time to visit Cape Flattery?</h3>\n    <p>The best times are sunrise and sunset for dramatic lighting and fewer crowds. Spring through fall offers the most pleasant weather, but Cape Flattery is accessible year-round thanks to its coastal location and minimal snowfall. Weekdays are significantly less crowded than weekends. I've had the most magical experiences during golden hour when the lighthouse on Tatoosh Island is beautifully illuminated against the dramatic sky. Weather can change rapidly, so always be prepared for rain regardless of the forecast.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Can I see whales from Cape Flattery?</h3>\n    <p>Yes, Cape Flattery is an excellent spot for whale watching! Gray whales migrate through the area, especially during spring and fall migrations (March-May and October-December). You might also spot orcas, humpback whales, sea lions, seals, and various seabirds from the viewing platforms. Bring binoculars for the best wildlife viewing experience, and be patient—marine life sightings require timing and luck, but the elevated platforms provide excellent vantage points for scanning the offshore waters.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Is Cape Flattery Trail suitable for families with kids?</h3>\n    <p>Yes, the Cape Flattery Trail is family-friendly and suitable for children who can walk 1.5 miles comfortably. The trail is short, mostly on well-maintained boardwalks, and has minimal elevation gain going out (though kids will need energy for the uphill return). However, supervise children carefully at the viewing platforms as they're positioned on high cliffs with safety railings. The trail can be muddy and slippery, so waterproof footwear is essential for little ones. Most families find this an exciting adventure that introduces kids to spectacular coastal scenery.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"color: #2c5530; font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Are dogs allowed on Cape Flattery Trail?</h3>\n    <p>Yes, leashed dogs are allowed on the Cape Flattery Trail, and it's actually a great hike for well-behaved pets. The Makah Tribe requires all pets to remain on leash and on the designated trail at all times for their safety and to protect the fragile ecosystem. Bring waste bags and pack out all dog waste, as there are no trash cans along the trail. The boardwalk sections make it easier for dogs to navigate muddy areas, but be cautious of wet wooden surfaces that can be slippery for both humans and pets.</p>\n\n    <div style=\"background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border: 1px solid #ffeaa7; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n        <p style=\"margin: 0; color: #856404;\"><strong>User Review Summary:</strong> \"Cape Flattery blew me away!

Standing at the northwestern tip of the contiguous United States, watching waves crash against ancient sea stacks while eagles soar overhead and whales breach in the distance, provides a profound connection to the raw power and beauty of the natural world.</p>\n\n    <p>What sets Cape Flattery apart from other coastal trails isn't just its spectacular scenery, but the way it combines accessibility with genuine wilderness experience. The relatively short distance and well-maintained boardwalks make it possible for hikers of all ages and abilities to reach these incredible viewpoints, yet the remote location and dramatic setting provide a true escape from everyday life.</p>\n\n    <p>The cultural significance of hiking on Makah Reservation land adds another layer of meaning to the experience. The tribe's exemplary stewardship of this pristine coastal environment serves as a model for conservation and sustainable tourism. By purchasing a recreation permit and following Leave No Trace principles, visitors directly support ongoing conservation efforts and help ensure that future generations can enjoy this remarkable place.</p>\n\n    <p>My multiple visits to Cape Flattery have taught me that this trail rewards careful planning and flexible expectations. Weather conditions can dramatically transform the experience—from crystal-clear days with views extending to Vancouver Island, to moody storm-watching sessions with massive waves and swirling fog. Each visit offers something unique, whether it's a wildlife encounter, perfect lighting for photography, or simply the meditative experience of listening to waves crash against the cliffs below.</p>\n\n    <p>For anyone planning to explore the Olympic Peninsula, Cape Flattery should absolutely be on your itinerary. Yes, it requires a significant drive from major population centers, and yes, you'll need to plan around weather and crowds. But the payoff is extraordinary—a chance to stand at one of America's most geographically significant points while experiencing some of the most spectacular coastal scenery in the Pacific Northwest.</p>\n\n    <p>Whether you're a serious hiker looking to check off another iconic destination, a family seeking an accessible outdoor adventure, or a photographer chasing dramatic coastal light, the Cape Flattery Trail delivers an experience that exceeds expectations. The combination of old-growth forest, rugged coastline, cultural significance, and wildlife viewing opportunities creates a hiking experience that's uniquely Pacific Northwestern and utterly unforgettable.</p>\n\n    <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/forma-cape-horn-hdry\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: #4a7c59; color: white; padding: 12px 25px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 8px; font-weight: bold; margin: 15px 5px; transition: all 0.3s;\">Explore Cape Horn Hiking Gear</a>\n    <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/cape-flattery-trail\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: #2c5530; color: white; padding: 12px 25px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 8px; font-weight: bold; margin: 15px 5px; transition: all 0.3s;\">Plan Your Cape Flattery Adventure</a>\n\n    <p>Pack your rain gear, charge your camera batteries, and prepare for an adventure to America's northwestern edge.
