When searching for <strong>horseback riding and ATV near me</strong>, you're essentially looking for the perfect balance between two distinct yet complementary outdoor pursuits that offer unique perspectives on nature's beauty.\n\nFrom my extensive experience guiding both activities, I've witnessed firsthand how this combination appeals to diverse groups and skill levels. The gentle, meditative rhythm of horseback riding provides a perfect counterbalance to the high-energy excitement of ATV exploration. This dynamic pairing allows participants to experience varied terrains and ecosystems that might be inaccessible through either activity alone.\n\n<div style=\"background: #e8f5e8; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #2c5530; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0; font-style: italic;\"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Many operators offer combination packages that are more cost-effective than booking activities separately, often including shared guides who are experts in both disciplines.</p>\n</div>\n\nThe logistical advantages are significant as well. Most facilities offering <strong>horseback riding and ATV near me</strong> have developed comprehensive programs that maximize your adventure time while minimizing travel between different locations. This efficiency means more time experiencing nature and less time in transit, making it ideal for day trips or vacation activities where time is precious.\n\nModern adventure tourism has recognized this powerful combination, with facilities across North America developing specialized programs. From the rugged terrain of Colorado's Rocky Mountains to the coastal trails of California, operators are creating unique experiences that showcase regional landscapes through both equestrian and motorized exploration.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/RIGWARL-Motorcycle-Touchscreen-Lightweight-Non-Slip/dp/B0978YM4FL?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: #ff9500; color: white; padding: 12px 24px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 4px; font-weight: bold; margin: 1rem 0;\">Shop Essential ATV Gloves on Amazon</a>\n\nThe educational component cannot be overlooked either. Experienced guides often incorporate natural history, wildlife observation, and environmental education into these combined adventures. This educational aspect transforms a simple recreational activity into an enriching experience that deepens your connection with the natural world while building practical outdoor skills.\n\n<h2 id=\"choosing-location\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;\">Choosing the Perfect Location Near You</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://d3rr2gvhjw0wwy.cloudfront.net/uploads/activity_galleries/156797/2000x2000-0-70-4c501b3c88b857e8bb62d01def02cb77.jpg\" alt=\"Scenic trail showing ATV and horseback riding paths through natural landscape\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 300px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n\nSelecting the ideal location for your <strong>horseback riding and ATV near me</strong> adventure requires careful consideration of several factors that will significantly impact your overall experience. Throughout my years of exploring different regions, I've developed a systematic approach to evaluating potential locations that ensures maximum enjoyment and safety.\n\nTerrain diversity should be your primary consideration when evaluating locations. The best facilities offer varied landscapes within their trail systems, including open meadows for comfortable horseback riding, challenging hill climbs for ATV excitement, and scenic overlooks that provide spectacular photo opportunities. I particularly recommend locations that feature at least three different ecosystem types, as this diversity creates a more engaging and educational experience.\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Regional Hotspots and Hidden Gems</h3>\n\nThe American West offers some of the most spectacular <strong>horseback riding and ATV near me</strong> opportunities, with facilities in Arizona, Colorado, and Utah leading the industry in terms of terrain quality and professional services. However, don't overlook excellent options in unexpected regions like the Appalachian Mountains, where facilities like those in Tennessee and North Carolina provide equally thrilling experiences amid stunning fall foliage.\n\nClimate considerations play a crucial role in location selection. Desert locations offer year-round availability but require careful planning around extreme temperatures, while mountain locations provide cooler summer temperatures but may have seasonal restrictions due to snow. Coastal facilities often feature the most moderate weather conditions but may have limited ATV terrain due to environmental regulations.\n\n<a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/atv-riding-places-near-me\" style=\"color: #2c5530; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\"><i>Discover the best ATV riding places</i></a> to enhance your adventure planning process. Research facilities that have been operating for at least five years, as this longevity typically indicates stable business practices, well-maintained equipment, and experienced staff.\n\nFacility amenities can make or break your experience, particularly for group adventures or family outings. Look for locations offering on-site restrooms, changing facilities, equipment storage, and food service options. The best facilities provide comprehensive packages that include professional photography services, allowing you to focus on the adventure while capturing memories professionally.\n\n<div style=\"background: #fff3cd; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #ff9500; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\"><strong>Important:</strong> Always verify that your chosen facility carries appropriate insurance and operates under proper permits. This verification protects both your safety and your financial investment in the adventure.</p>\n</div>\n\nTransportation logistics should influence your location choice, especially for group adventures. Facilities located within 90 minutes of major metropolitan areas offer the best balance of accessibility and wilderness experience. However, more remote locations often provide superior trail quality and wildlife viewing opportunities that justify extended travel times.\n\n<h2 id=\"essential-gear\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;\">Essential Gear and Equipment Guide</h2>\n\nProper equipment selection makes the difference between an enjoyable adventure and an uncomfortable or potentially dangerous experience. Through years of testing different gear combinations across various climates and terrains, I've developed definitive recommendations for <strong>horseback riding and ATV near me</strong> adventures that prioritize both safety and comfort.\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Safety Equipment Essentials</h3>\n\nHelmet selection represents your most critical safety decision. For ATV portions, invest in a DOT-approved helmet with adequate ventilation and comfortable padding. I personally recommend full-face helmets for maximum protection, particularly for beginners who may be more prone to falls or impacts. For horseback riding, traditional equestrian helmets provide better visibility and communication with your guide while maintaining essential head protection.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/DOT-Youth-Dirt-Bike-Helmet/dp/B0BLMQX6ZG?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: #ff9500; color: white; padding: 12px 24px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 4px; font-weight: bold; margin: 1rem 0;\">Get DOT-Approved Youth Helmet</a>\n\nEye protection becomes crucial during ATV segments, where dust, debris, and insects present constant hazards. Quality safety glasses or goggles should feature UV protection, anti-fog coating, and secure retention systems. I've found wraparound styles work best as they provide peripheral protection while maintaining clear vision of your surroundings and trail conditions.\n\nProtective clothing serves multiple functions beyond basic comfort. Long pants are non-negotiable for both activities, providing protection from branches, brush, and potential contact with equipment. Denim works adequately for occasional riders, but purpose-built riding pants offer superior durability and comfort for extended adventures.\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Comfort and Performance Gear</h3>\n\n<img src=\"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/0b/29/01/b0.jpg\" alt=\"Horseback riding with ATV adventure showing proper gear and equipment in outdoor setting\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 300px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n\nFootwear selection significantly impacts your experience across both activities. Sturdy boots with heels work best for horseback riding, providing necessary stirrup security and ankle support. For ATV riding, the same boots offer excellent pedal control and protection from hot engine components. Avoid sneakers or sandals, as these provide inadequate protection and can create safety hazards.\n\nGlove selection enhances control and prevents fatigue during extended adventures. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/COFIT-Motorcycle-Gloves-Breathable-Touchscreen/dp/B094VMZ7KQ?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"color: #2c5530; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\">High-quality motorcycle gloves</a> with touchscreen compatibility allow you to operate cameras and phones without removing protection. Look for gloves featuring knuckle protection, palm reinforcement, and breathable materials that prevent excessive sweating.\n\nWeather-appropriate layers allow you to adapt to changing conditions throughout your adventure. Mountain and desert environments can experience significant temperature swings, making layering systems essential for comfort. Start with moisture-wicking base layers, add insulating mid-layers as needed, and always pack a waterproof outer shell regardless of weather forecasts.\n\n<div style=\"background: #d1ecf1; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #17a2b8; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\"><strong>Gear Tip:</strong> Pack a small daypack with essentials including water, snacks, first aid supplies, and emergency contact information. Many facilities provide saddlebags for horseback segments and ATV storage compartments.</p>\n</div>\n\nCommunication and navigation tools become particularly important for longer adventures or when exploring unfamiliar territories. While guides typically handle navigation, carrying a fully charged smartphone with offline maps downloaded provides valuable backup. Consider portable chargers or power banks to maintain device functionality throughout extended adventures.\n\n<h2 id=\"safety-protocols\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;\">Safety Protocols and Best Practices</h2>\n\nSafety protocols form the foundation of every successful <strong>horseback riding and ATV near me</strong> adventure, and understanding these principles can mean the difference between an amazing experience and a dangerous situation. Throughout my career, I've witnessed how proper preparation and adherence to established safety protocols dramatically reduce risks while enhancing overall enjoyment.\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Pre-Adventure Safety Briefing</h3>\n\nEvery reputable facility begins with comprehensive safety briefings covering both activities. During horseback riding instruction, pay particular attention to proper mounting and dismounting techniques, basic rein control, and emergency procedures for various scenarios. Understanding your horse's temperament and recognizing signs of distress or agitation can prevent many potential problems before they escalate.\n\nATV safety instruction should cover vehicle operation basics, including throttle control, braking techniques, and proper body positioning for various terrain types. Learn to recognize hazardous conditions such as steep inclines, loose surfaces, and obstacles that require special attention. Understanding your ATV's capabilities and limitations prevents overconfidence that leads to accidents.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fFsE2cQpJc\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 400px; border: none; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\nEmergency procedures represent critical knowledge that every participant must understand before beginning their adventure. Know how to signal for help, understand basic first aid principles, and familiarize yourself with evacuation procedures for your specific location. Most professional guides carry comprehensive first aid kits and communication devices, but understanding your role in emergency situations proves invaluable.\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Trail Etiquette and Environmental Responsibility</h3>\n\nResponsible trail usage protects both the environment and ensures continued access to these recreational opportunities. When riding horses, maintain appropriate spacing from other riders to prevent crowding and potential conflicts between animals. Stay on designated trails to prevent erosion and protect fragile ecosystems that support local wildlife populations.\n\n<a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/camping-and-atv-riding-near-me\" style=\"color: #2c5530; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Camping and ATV riding combinations</b></a> require additional environmental considerations, including proper waste disposal, campfire restrictions, and wildlife interaction protocols that protect both adventurers and local animal populations.\n\nATV operation demands heightened environmental awareness, as these vehicles can cause significant damage when operated irresponsibly. Avoid sensitive areas such as wetlands, steep slopes prone to erosion, and areas with fragile vegetation. Respect private property boundaries and seasonal restrictions designed to protect wildlife during breeding or migration periods.\n\n<div style=\"background: #f8d7da; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #dc3545; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\"><strong>Safety Alert:</strong> Never attempt to ride alone, especially in unfamiliar territory. The buddy system provides crucial backup in case of mechanical failures, injuries, or getting lost on trail systems.</p>\n</div>\n\nWeather monitoring becomes especially important for outdoor adventures that span several hours. Understanding how to recognize approaching severe weather and knowing appropriate shelter procedures can prevent dangerous situations. Many accidents occur when adventurers push forward despite deteriorating conditions rather than seeking appropriate shelter or returning to base facilities.\n\nGroup dynamics significantly influence safety outcomes during combined adventures. Establish clear communication protocols, identify the most experienced rider as a secondary leader, and ensure all participants understand hand signals and voice commands used by guides. Maintain visual contact with other group members and never attempt to separate from the established group without guide approval.\n\n<h2 id=\"my-experience\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;\">My Experience: Lessons from 15 Years of Adventures</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://media.tacdn.com/media/photo-m/1280/24/16/dd/0d/atv-adventure-horseback.jpg\" alt=\"Personal adventure experience showing ATV and horseback riding adventure in scenic mountain terrain\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 300px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n\nFifteen years of exploring <strong>horseback riding and ATV near me</strong> opportunities across North America has taught me invaluable lessons about what makes these adventures truly exceptional. My journey began somewhat accidentally during a family vacation in Colorado, where a last-minute booking at a local ranch introduced me to the magic of combining these two distinct outdoor activities.\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Early Mistakes and Hard-Learned Lessons</h3>\n\nMy first major lesson came during a summer adventure in Arizona's Sonoran Desert, where I seriously underestimated the importance of proper hydration and sun protection. Despite warnings from our guide, I packed insufficient water and relied on cotton clothing that provided inadequate protection from intense desert sun. By midday, I was experiencing early signs of heat exhaustion that could have turned dangerous without immediate intervention.\n\nThis experience taught me to always pack twice the water I think I'll need and invest in proper sun-protective clothing designed for desert environments. Now I recommend a minimum of one gallon of water per person for full-day desert adventures, along with electrolyte supplements and high-SPF sunscreen applied every two hours regardless of cloud cover.\n\nEquipment failures provided some of my most valuable learning experiences. During a spring ride in Tennessee's Smoky Mountains, a poorly maintained ATV experienced brake failure on a steep descent, forcing me to use engine braking and terrain features to safely stop. This incident reinforced the importance of thorough pre-ride inspections and choosing facilities that maintain their equipment to professional standards.\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Memorable Encounters and Wildlife Experiences</h3>\n\nOne of my most memorable experiences occurred during a dawn ride in Wyoming's Yellowstone region, where our group encountered a small herd of elk grazing in an alpine meadow. Our guide's expertise in animal behavior allowed us to observe these magnificent creatures from a respectful distance while learning about their habitat requirements and seasonal migration patterns.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Troxel-Very-Peri-Duratec-Liberty/dp/B00I0SCN54?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: #ff9500; color: white; padding: 12px 24px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 4px; font-weight: bold; margin: 1rem 0;\">Professional Riding Helmets Available</a>\n\nWeather challenges have provided some of my most educational and character-building experiences. A sudden thunderstorm during a Colorado mountain ride taught me the importance of monitoring weather conditions and having contingency plans. Our guide's quick decision to seek shelter in a natural cave system turned a potentially dangerous situation into an impromptu geology lesson about regional rock formations.\n\nThe social aspects of these adventures often prove as rewarding as the natural experiences themselves. I've formed lasting friendships with fellow adventurers from diverse backgrounds, united by shared experiences of conquering challenging trails and witnessing spectacular sunrises from remote mountain peaks.\n\n<div style=\"background: #d4edda; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #28a745; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0; font-style: italic;\"><strong>Personal Insight:</strong> The most transformative adventures occur when you step slightly outside your comfort zone. Challenge yourself with longer rides or more technical terrain as your skills develop.</p>\n</div>\n\nPhotography has become an integral part of my adventures, and I've learned valuable techniques for capturing both action shots and scenic landscapes while maintaining safety focus. The key is planning photo opportunities during natural rest stops rather than attempting to multitask while actively riding. Many of my favorite images were captured during early morning or late afternoon when lighting conditions create dramatic shadows and highlight terrain features.\n\n<h2 id=\"seasonal-planning\" style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0;\">Seasonal Planning and Weather Considerations</h2>\n\nStrategic seasonal planning transforms good <strong>horseback riding and ATV near me</strong> adventures into extraordinary experiences that showcase regional landscapes at their most spectacular. Each season offers unique advantages and presents specific challenges that require careful preparation and appropriate expectations for optimal enjoyment.\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Spring Adventures: Renewal and Challenges</h3>\n\nSpring represents my favorite season for <strong>horseback riding and ATV near me</strong> adventures, despite presenting certain logistical challenges. The combination of moderate temperatures, blooming wildflowers, and active wildlife creates unparalleled opportunities for memorable experiences. However, spring weather patterns can be unpredictable, requiring flexible planning and appropriate gear for rapidly changing conditions.\n\n<img src=\"https://d3rr2gvhjw0wwy.cloudfront.net/uploads/activity_galleries/156797/2000x2000-0-70-1c9fbb5117851b1469c4c54884eaf11b.jpg\" alt=\"Spring horseback riding and ATV adventure showing blooming landscape and ideal weather conditions\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 300px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n\nTrail conditions during spring require special attention, as winter runoff and spring rains can create muddy conditions that affect both horseback riding safety and ATV traction. Many facilities adjust their trail routes during this period, often providing access to areas that become too dry or hot during summer months. This seasonal route variation offers unique perspectives on familiar landscapes.\n\n<a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/outdoor-atv-riding-near-me\" style=\"color: #2c5530; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\"><i>Outdoor ATV riding opportunities</i></a> expand significantly during spring as snow melts open higher elevation trails that remain inaccessible during winter months. However, this increased access requires additional preparation for variable conditions and potential weather delays.\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">Summer Peak Season: Opportunities and Precautions</h3>\n\nSummer offers the most consistent weather conditions and longest daylight hours for extended adventures, making it ideal for full-day experiences and multi-day packages. However, popular locations can become crowded during peak summer months, potentially diminishing the wilderness experience that many adventurers seek.\n\nHeat management becomes crucial during summer adventures, particularly in southern and southwestern regions where temperatures can exceed 100°F by midday. Early morning starts allow you to experience cooler temperatures and often provide better wildlife viewing opportunities as many animals are more active during dawn hours.\n\nHydration requirements increase significantly during summer adventures, and I recommend carrying 50% more water than you think necessary. Electrolyte replacement becomes important for adventures exceeding two hours, as both physical exertion and sun exposure accelerate fluid and mineral loss through perspiration.\n\n<div style=\"background: #fff3cd; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\"><strong>Summer Safety:</strong> Schedule regular shade breaks every 45-60 minutes during hot weather adventures.

Most facilities provide basic instruction for horseback riding fundamentals including mounting, dismounting, basic rein control, and emergency procedures. ATV instruction covers vehicle operation, throttle control, braking techniques, and proper body positioning for various terrain types.\n\nYou'll typically start with easier trails to build confidence before progressing to more challenging terrain. The experience combines the peaceful connection with horses and the adrenaline rush of ATV riding, often spanning 2-4 hours total depending on package selection. Expect multiple rest stops for hydration, photography opportunities, and guide-led discussions about local wildlife and geology. Professional guides monitor your comfort level throughout and adjust pace accordingly.\n\nMost facilities provide all necessary safety equipment, but bringing personal gear ensures proper fit and comfort. Weather conditions significantly impact the experience, so prepare for variable conditions even if forecasts appear favorable. Group sizes typically range from 4-12 participants, creating intimate experiences while maintaining safety oversight.\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">What safety equipment is required for horseback riding and ATV adventures?</h3>\n\nEssential safety equipment includes DOT-approved helmets for ATV riding, comfortable riding boots with heels for horseback riding, long pants made from durable materials, and protective gloves for both activities. Many facilities provide helmets, but bringing your own ensures proper fit and hygiene standards. Eye protection such as safety glasses or goggles is crucial for ATV portions where dust, debris, and insects present constant hazards.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Premium-Riding-Crop-Horse-Whip/dp/B07V1X43FD?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"color: #2c5530; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\">Professional riding equipment</a> enhances both safety and control during horseback segments. Knee pads and elbow pads are recommended for beginners on ATVs, as falls during learning phases are common and typically minor with proper protection.\n\nWeather-appropriate clothing layers allow adaptation to changing conditions throughout adventures. Pack rain gear regardless of weather forecasts, as mountain and desert environments can experience sudden weather changes. Sturdy boots with ankle support work for both activities and provide necessary protection from equipment contact and rough terrain.\n\nEmergency items should include a basic first aid kit, emergency contact information, and fully charged communication devices. Many facilities provide emergency equipment, but personal preparation demonstrates responsibility and provides backup capabilities in remote locations.\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">How much does a combined horseback riding and ATV tour typically cost?</h3>\n\nCombined horseback riding and ATV tours typically range from $150-$350 per person, depending on duration, location, and inclusions such as meals, professional photography, or equipment rental. Half-day adventures lasting 2-3 hours average $180-$220 per person, while full-day experiences with lunch and extended trail access can reach $300-$350 per person.\n\nGroup discounts significantly reduce individual costs, with many facilities offering 10-15% reductions for groups of six or more participants. Seasonal pricing affects costs substantially, with peak summer rates typically 20-30% higher than shoulder season pricing during spring and fall months.\n\nPackage deals combining accommodations, meals, and multiple activity days provide the best overall value for extended vacations. Budget an additional 15-20% for guide tips, optional professional photos, and incidental expenses like snacks or beverages. Some facilities include equipment rental in base pricing while others charge separately for specialized gear.\n\nAdvanced booking often provides cost savings through early-bird discounts, while last-minute bookings may offer reduced rates for unfilled spots during off-peak periods. Travel insurance becomes important for expensive packages, protecting your investment against weather cancellations or personal emergencies.\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2c5530; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;\">What's the best time of year for horseback riding and ATV adventures?</h3>\n\nThe optimal season varies by geographic region, but generally spring through fall offers the best balance of weather conditions, trail accessibility, and wildlife activity. Spring provides mild temperatures, blooming landscapes, and active wildlife emerging from winter dormancy, though trail conditions may be affected by runoff and spring rains.\n\nSummer offers the most consistent weather patterns and longest daylight hours, making it ideal for extended adventures and photography. However, extreme heat in southwestern regions requires early morning starts and increased hydration planning.
