The wrong shoes don't just cause discomfort—they can lead to serious long-term health issues affecting your feet, legs, and back.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">During my extensive testing at various national parks and hiking trails, I've witnessed countless visitors struggling with inappropriate footwear. Women particularly face unique challenges due to differences in foot anatomy, including narrower heels, wider forefoot areas, and different pressure distribution patterns compared to men.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">The consequences of poor footwear choices extend far beyond temporary discomfort. Research published in the Journal of Foot and Ankle Research shows that inappropriate shoes contribute to plantar fasciitis, bunions, and lower back pain—conditions that affect millions of women annually. Healthcare workers, retail employees, teachers, and outdoor enthusiasts need tennis shoes that can withstand 8-12 hours of continuous use while maintaining structural integrity and comfort.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Quality tennis shoes designed for extended wear incorporate advanced materials and technologies that weren't available just a decade ago. Modern EVA foams, gel cushioning systems, and engineered mesh uppers work together to create shoes that adapt to your foot's natural movement while providing consistent support throughout the day. The investment in proper footwear pays dividends in reduced fatigue, improved posture, and enhanced overall well-being.</p>\n\n    <div style=\"background: #e8f4f8; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 4px solid #3498db;\">\n        <p style=\"margin: 0; font-style: italic; color: #2c3e50;\"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> I always recommend trying on tennis shoes in the afternoon when your feet are naturally slightly swollen, mimicking the conditions after hours of walking and standing. This ensures a comfortable fit throughout your longest days.</p>\n    </div>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"top-shoes\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n    <h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #3498db; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Top 7 Best Tennis Shoes for Walking and Standing All Day Women's</h2>\n\n    <div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px;\">1.

The engineered jacquard knit upper adapts to foot shape while maintaining breathability, and the 7mm heel drop promotes natural foot movement.</p>\n        \n        <div style=\"background: #f8f9fa; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n            <p style=\"margin: 0; font-weight: 600;\">Key Features:</p>\n            <ul style=\"margin: 10px 0 0 20px; padding: 0;\">\n                <li>Maximum cushioning with wide base stability</li>\n                <li>Breathable jacquard knit upper</li>\n                <li>Meta-rocker design for smooth transitions</li>\n                <li>Available in regular, wide, and x-wide widths</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n        \n        <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n            <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7XYZHQR?tag=natureguests00-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: #ff9500; color: white; padding: 15px 30px; border-radius: 25px; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600; transition: background 0.3s;\">\n                <i class=\"fas fa-shopping-cart\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\"></i>Check Price on Amazon\n            </a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px; clear: both;\">\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px;\">2. ASICS Gel-Nimbus 27 - Best for Plantar Fasciitis</h3>\n        \n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">The ASICS Gel-Nimbus 27 emerges as the ideal choice for women dealing with plantar fasciitis or high arches. This shoe features a firmer midsole structure that prevents excessive foot collapse while providing targeted heel cushioning through ASICS' renowned GEL technology.</p>\n        \n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">I've personally recommended this model to numerous visitors at ranger stations who complained of heel pain during their park visits. The structured sole design and adaptive stability features make it one of the most supportive options in the <b>best tennis shoes for walking and standing all day women's</b> category.</p>\n        \n        <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n            <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZQXJ8NK?tag=natureguests00-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: #ff9500; color: white; padding: 15px 30px; border-radius: 25px; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600; transition: background 0.3s;\">\n                <i class=\"fas fa-shopping-cart\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\"></i>Check Price on Amazon\n            </a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\">\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px;\">3. Ryka Devotion X - Best Budget Choice</h3>\n        \n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">At just $90, the Ryka Devotion X proves that you don't need to spend a fortune on quality tennis shoes. Designed specifically for women's biomechanics, this shoe features a narrower heel and roomier forefoot, addressing the unique anatomical differences in women's feet.</p>\n        \n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">The women-specific design includes strategic cushioning and arch support that I've found particularly beneficial for nurses, teachers, and retail workers.

Through my years of testing and research, I've identified the key characteristics that separate exceptional shoes from merely adequate ones.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Cushioning Technology and Stack Height</h3>\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">The foundation of any great all-day shoe lies in its cushioning system. Modern tennis shoes utilize advanced foam compounds like EVA, TPU, and proprietary blends that provide impact absorption while maintaining responsiveness. A heel stack height of 30mm or greater typically offers sufficient cushioning for extended wear, though personal preference and body weight influence the ideal thickness.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">During my testing at various national parks, I found that shoes with progressive cushioning—firmer at the heel and softer at the forefoot—provided the best balance of support and comfort. This design mirrors the natural pressure distribution during walking and standing activities.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Arch Support and Stability Features</h3>\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Proper arch support prevents foot fatigue and maintains healthy alignment throughout the day. The best tennis shoes incorporate medial posts, TPU shanks, or density variations in the midsole to control excessive pronation while allowing natural foot movement. Women with high arches require different support than those with flat feet, making it crucial to understand your foot type.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Upper Construction and Breathability</h3>\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">The shoe upper plays a vital role in comfort and foot health during extended wear. Engineered mesh, knit fabrics, and strategic ventilation zones prevent moisture buildup and hot spots. The upper must also provide structure without restricting natural foot expansion that occurs throughout the day.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">I've noticed that shoes with seamless construction and padded collar areas significantly reduce the risk of blisters and pressure points during long wearing periods. The fit should be snug but not restrictive, allowing for natural foot swelling.</p>\n\n    <div style=\"background: #fff3cd; border: 1px solid #ffeaa7; border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; clear: both;\">\n        <h4 style=\"color: #856404; margin-bottom: 10px; font-weight: 600;\"><i class=\"fas fa-exclamation-triangle\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\"></i>Important Consideration</h4>\n        <p style=\"color: #856404; margin: 0;\">Shoes that feel perfect in the store may become uncomfortable after several hours of wear. Always consider how the shoe will perform during your longest days, not just during a brief fitting session.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">For those interested in specific foot conditions, our guides on <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-shoes-for-pregnancy-and-standing-all-day\" style=\"color: #3498db; text-decoration: none;\"><b>best shoes for pregnancy and standing all day</b></a> and <i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-brooks-for-walking-and-standing-all-day\" style=\"color: #3498db; text-decoration: none;\">best Brooks for walking and standing all day</a></i> provide specialized recommendations.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"personal-experience\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n    <h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #3498db; padding-bottom: 10px;\">My Personal Experience Testing These Shoes</h2>\n\n    <div style=\"background: #f1f8e9; border-left: 5px solid #4caf50; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">\n        <h3 style=\"color: #2e7d32; margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 1.3rem;\"><i class=\"fas fa-user-check\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\"></i>Personal Testing Protocol</h3>\n        <p style=\"margin: 0; color: #2e7d32;\">Over 18 months, I tested 25+ pairs of tennis shoes across different terrains, weather conditions, and activity levels. Each pair received minimum 100 hours of wear before evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">My journey to find the <strong>best tennis shoes for walking and standing all day women's</strong> began during my first season as a national park ranger. After experiencing severe foot pain during 12-hour shifts, I realized that proper footwear wasn't just a comfort issue—it was essential for job performance and long-term health.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">The testing process involved wearing each pair for different scenarios: leading nature walks on rocky trails, standing at visitor centers on concrete floors, and hiking maintenance routes on various terrain types. I documented comfort levels, durability signs, and any developing issues throughout extended wear periods.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">The Hoka Clifton 10 emerged as my personal favorite after surviving a particularly challenging week at Yellowstone, where I logged over 15 miles daily on mixed terrain. Even after the fifth consecutive day, my feet felt surprisingly fresh, with no hot spots or pressure points developing. The shoe's rocker design proved especially beneficial during long walks with visitor groups, reducing leg fatigue significantly.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Conversely, several popular models that performed well in initial comfort tests failed during extended use. One well-known brand developed heel slippage after the cushioning compressed, while another caused arch pain during standing activities despite feeling comfortable while walking.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">The ASICS Gel-Nimbus 27 particularly impressed me during winter months when concrete surfaces felt especially hard and unforgiving. The structured support prevented the foot fatigue that typically developed during long indoor shifts, and the cushioning remained consistent even after months of daily use.</p>\n\n    <div style=\"background: #e8f5e8; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n        <h4 style=\"color: #2e7d32; margin-bottom: 10px; font-weight: 600;\">Key Lessons Learned:</h4>\n        <ul style=\"margin: 10px 0 0 20px; padding: 0; color: #2e7d32;\">\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Initial comfort doesn't guarantee long-term performance</li>\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Shoe rotation extends lifespan and maintains foot health</li>\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Weather conditions significantly impact shoe performance</li>\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Personal biomechanics matter more than generic reviews</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">The seasonal aspect of footwear needs became evident during my year-round testing. Summer months required enhanced breathability, while winter demanded better traction and weather resistance. This experience led me to recommend seasonal rotations for optimal comfort and performance.</p>\n\n    <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x1BARjjK9YY\" title=\"Best Shoes for Walking and Standing All Day 2025 by a Foot Specialist\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0;\"></iframe>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">This expert review from a foot specialist validates many of my personal findings and provides professional insights into what makes shoes truly effective for all-day wear.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"user-reviews\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n    <h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #3498db; padding-bottom: 10px;\">User Reviews and Real-World Experiences</h2>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">To provide comprehensive coverage of the <strong>best tennis shoes for walking and standing all day women's</strong> market, I've compiled authentic user experiences from various sources.

Through my extensive experience helping park visitors choose appropriate footwear, I've developed a systematic approach to shoe selection that ensures optimal comfort and performance.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Assess Your Foot Type and Gait Pattern</h3>\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Understanding your foot architecture forms the foundation of proper shoe selection. High-arched feet require different support than flat feet, while overpronators need stability features that supinators don't. A simple wet foot test can reveal your arch height, while gait analysis at specialty stores provides detailed information about your walking pattern.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">During my ranger training, we learned that women's feet differ significantly from men's in shape, biomechanics, and pressure distribution. Women typically have narrower heels, wider forefeet, and different pronation patterns, making gender-specific designs crucial for optimal comfort and performance.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Consider Your Primary Usage Environment</h3>\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">The surfaces you'll encounter most frequently should influence your shoe choice. Healthcare workers on hospital floors need different features than retail employees on carpeted surfaces or outdoor professionals on varied terrain. Concrete surfaces demand maximum cushioning, while softer surfaces may allow for firmer, more responsive soles.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Evaluate Your Specific Needs</h3>\n    <div style=\"background: #f8f9fa; border: 1px solid #e5e5e5; border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n        <h4 style=\"margin-bottom: 15px; color: #2c3e50;\">Key Questions to Consider:</h4>\n        <ul style=\"margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 0;\">\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">How many hours will you wear the shoes daily?</li>\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">Do you have existing foot conditions or pain?</li>\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">What's your budget for quality footwear?</li>\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">Do you need professional appearance requirements?</li>\n            <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">Will you need multiple pairs for rotation?</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Proper Fitting Guidelines</h3>\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Shoe fitting should always occur later in the day when feet are naturally swollen, mimicking conditions after hours of activity. Ensure at least thumb-width space between longest toe and shoe end, and verify that the widest part of your foot aligns with the widest part of the shoe.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Many women make the mistake of buying shoes that fit perfectly in the morning, only to find them uncomfortably tight by afternoon. Professional fitting at specialty stores often reveals size discrepancies between feet, requiring accommodation for the larger foot.</p>\n\n    <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Budget Considerations and Value Assessment</h3>\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">While premium shoes often provide better long-term value through improved durability and comfort, excellent budget options exist for those with spending constraints. Calculate cost per wear rather than initial price—a $150 shoe lasting 8 months costs less per day than a $50 shoe lasting 2 months.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; clear: both;\">Consider the hidden costs of inadequate footwear, including potential medical expenses for foot problems, lost productivity due to discomfort, and frequent replacement costs. Investing in quality footwear often proves economical over time while providing significant health benefits.</p>\n\n    <div style=\"background: #e8f4f8; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 4px solid #3498db;\">\n        <h4 style=\"color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 10px; font-weight: 600;\"><i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb\" style=\"margin-right: 10px; color: #f39c12;\"></i>Professional Tip</h4>\n        <p style=\"margin: 0; color: #2c3e50;\">Always try on both shoes and walk around the store for at least 10 minutes. Different manufacturing tolerances can create size variations between left and right shoes, and brief standing doesn't reveal potential pressure points that develop during extended wear.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">For those seeking alternatives to traditional athletic shoes, consider exploring our guides on <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-slip-on-shoes-for-walking-and-standing-all-day\" style=\"color: #3498db; text-decoration: none;\"><i>best slip-on shoes for walking and standing all day</i></a> or <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-sandals-for-walking-and-standing-all-day\" style=\"color: #3498db; text-decoration: none;\">best sandals for walking and standing all day</a></b> for warmer climates.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"conclusion\" style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\">\n    <h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 3px solid #3498db; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">After extensive testing, research, and real-world experience, choosing the <strong>best tennis shoes for walking and standing all day women's</strong> needs ultimately depends on individual requirements, foot type, and specific usage patterns. However, the models featured in this guide represent the top performers across various categories and price points.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">The Hoka Clifton 10 emerges as my top overall recommendation for most women, offering exceptional comfort, durability, and versatility. For those with specific conditions like plantar fasciitis, the ASICS Gel-Nimbus 27 provides targeted support, while budget-conscious buyers will find excellent value in the Ryka Devotion X.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Remember that proper footwear is an investment in your long-term health and daily comfort. The cost of quality shoes pales in comparison to the expense and discomfort of foot problems, back pain, and reduced mobility that can result from inadequate footwear choices.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">As you make your decision, consider starting with one pair from our recommended list and evaluating its performance in your specific environment. Many users find that rotating between two pairs extends shoe lifespan while ensuring consistent support and comfort throughout the week.</p>\n\n    <div style=\"background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); color: white; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;\">\n        <h3 style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.5rem; color: white;\">Ready to Transform Your Daily Comfort?</h3>\n        <p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem;\">Don't let foot pain limit your potential.

Key elements include EVA or foam midsoles for shock absorption, proper heel-to-toe drop for natural walking motion, wide toe boxes for comfort, and lightweight design to reduce fatigue. Quality tennis shoes also provide ankle stability and moisture-wicking properties to keep feet comfortable during extended wear. Modern materials like engineered mesh and advanced foam compounds work together to create shoes that adapt to your foot's needs throughout long days.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\">\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px; cursor: pointer;\" onclick=\"toggleAnswer('faq2')\">\n            <i class=\"fas fa-plus\" id=\"icon2\" style=\"margin-right: 10px; color: #3498db; transition: transform 0.3s;\"></i>\n            How often should I replace tennis shoes used for daily walking and standing?\n        </h3>\n        <div id=\"faq2\" style=\"display: none; padding-left: 30px; color: #555; line-height: 1.6;\">\n            <p>Tennis shoes used for daily walking and standing typically need replacement every 6-8 months or 300-500 miles of use, whichever comes first. Signs it's time to replace include compressed cushioning, worn outsole treads, heel pain returning, or visible wear patterns. For healthcare workers or those standing 8+ hours daily, shoes may need replacement more frequently. Rotating between two pairs can extend overall lifespan and maintain better foot health. Pay attention to how your feet feel at the end of the day—increasing discomfort often signals declining shoe support and the need for replacement.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\">\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px; cursor: pointer;\" onclick=\"toggleAnswer('faq3')\">\n            <i class=\"fas fa-plus\" id=\"icon3\" style=\"margin-right: 10px; color: #3498db; transition: transform 0.3s;\"></i>\n            Are expensive tennis shoes worth it for all-day wear?\n        </h3>\n        <div id=\"faq3\" style=\"display: none; padding-left: 30px; color: #555; line-height: 1.6;\">\n            <p>Premium tennis shoes often provide better long-term value for all-day wear due to superior materials, advanced cushioning technology, and improved durability. While budget options like Ryka Devotion X ($90) offer excellent value, investing in brands like Hoka, ASICS, or Brooks typically results in better comfort, longer lifespan, and reduced foot fatigue. The cost per day of comfortable, healthy feet often justifies the higher initial investment for quality tennis shoes. Consider that expensive medical treatments for foot problems cost far more than preventive investment in quality footwear.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\">\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px; cursor: pointer;\" onclick=\"toggleAnswer('faq4')\">\n            <i class=\"fas fa-plus\" id=\"icon4\" style=\"margin-right: 10px; color: #3498db; transition: transform 0.3s;\"></i>\n            Can I use running shoes instead of tennis shoes for walking and standing?\n        </h3>\n        <div id=\"faq4\" style=\"display: none; padding-left: 30px; color: #555; line-height: 1.6;\">\n            <p>Yes, many modern running shoes excel for walking and standing all day, often providing superior cushioning and support compared to traditional tennis shoes. Popular choices include Hoka Clifton, ASICS Gel-Nimbus, and Brooks Glycerin series. Running shoes designed for daily training typically offer better shock absorption and comfort for extended wear. However, ensure they provide adequate lateral stability if your activities involve side-to-side movement. The key difference lies in the intended motion—running shoes optimize for forward movement, while tennis shoes traditionally offer more lateral support for court sports.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\">\n        <h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px; cursor: pointer;\" onclick=\"toggleAnswer('faq5')\">\n            <i class=\"fas fa-plus\" id=\"icon5\" style=\"margin-right: 10px; color: #3498db; transition: transform 0.3s;\"></i>\n            What features should I prioritize in tennis shoes for plantar fasciitis?\n        </h3>\n        <div id=\"faq5\" style=\"display: none; padding-left: 30px; color: #555; line-height: 1.6;\">\n            <p>For plantar fasciitis, prioritize tennis shoes with firm arch support, heel cushioning, and structured midsoles. Look for shoes with 10mm+ heel drop, removable insoles for custom orthotics, and brands recommended by podiatrists like ASICS Gel-Nimbus or Brooks Addiction Walker. Avoid overly soft shoes that allow foot collapse. Proper heel counter support and motion control features help reduce plantar fascia strain during extended walking and standing activities. The goal is to support the foot's natural arch while providing cushioning for the inflamed heel area.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 30px 0; padding: 20px; background: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 10px;\">\n    <p style=\"margin: 0; color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem;\">This guide represents extensive research and personal testing.
