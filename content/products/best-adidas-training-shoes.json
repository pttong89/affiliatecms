What started as a brand primarily known for running and soccer has transformed into a powerhouse that rivals <i><b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/nike-training-shoes\" style=\"color: #0066cc;\">Nike training shoes</a></b></i> in both performance and innovation. The German engineering approach that made Adidas famous has been perfectly applied to create training shoes that excel in stability, durability, and versatility.</p>\n\n<p>The secret lies in Adidas's material science innovations. Their Lightstrike foam technology provides responsive cushioning without compromising stability, while the Continental rubber outsoles offer grip that I've tested on everything from gym floors to outdoor concrete surfaces. During my winter training sessions in Denver, these outsoles maintained traction even on slightly damp surfaces, something I couldn't say about many competitor brands. The dual-density midsole construction in models like the Dropset 3 represents years of biomechanical research, creating the perfect balance between forefoot flexibility for dynamic movements and heel stability for heavy lifting.</p>\n\n<p>What truly sets Adidas apart in 2025 is their understanding of the modern athlete's needs. Today's fitness enthusiasts don't just lift weights or just do cardio – they demand shoes that can transition seamlessly between squats, box jumps, rope climbs, and short runs. After consulting with trainers at three different CrossFit boxes and two powerlifting gyms, I found that Adidas consistently ranked as the most versatile option. The brand's commitment to sustainability, using recycled ocean plastic in many models, also resonates with environmentally conscious athletes. When you combine superior performance with ethical manufacturing, you get a brand that's positioned to dominate the decade ahead.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"top-7-shoes\" style=\"margin: 40px 0;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #1a1a1a; border-bottom: 3px solid #0066cc; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Top 7 Best Adidas Training Shoes for 2025</h2>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 30px 0 15px 0; color: #2c3e50;\">1. Adidas Dropset 3 - The Ultimate All-Around Champion</h3>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.runrepeat.com/storage/gallery/product_primary/40409/adidas-dropset-3-lab-test-and-review-21870266-main.jpg\" alt=\"Adidas Dropset 3 training shoes cut in half showing dual-density midsole construction and technical features for weightlifting and cross-training\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\n<p>The Dropset 3 represents the pinnacle of cross-training shoe design, and after six months of intensive testing, it's earned its place as my top recommendation. With a 6mm heel-to-toe drop and dual-density midsole, this shoe excels at everything from heavy deadlifts to high-intensity circuit training. The forefoot density of 31.1 HA provides sufficient cushioning for plyometric exercises, while the heel's 47.0 HA offers rock-solid stability for lifting. I've successfully deadlifted 485 pounds in these shoes without any instability issues.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background: #fff3cd; border: 1px solid #ffeaa7; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 15px 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0; font-weight: 600; color: #856404;\"><strong>Key Specifications:</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"margin: 10px 0 0 0; color: #856404;\">\n<li>Heel-to-toe drop: 6mm</li>\n<li>Weight: 10.15 oz (size 10)</li>\n<li>Price range: $104-130</li>\n<li>Best for: All-around training, weightlifting, CrossFit</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<a href=\"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CKMNH184?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ff6b35 0%, #ff8c42 100%); color: white; padding: 12px 25px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 25px; font-weight: 600; margin: 15px 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); transition: all 0.3s ease;\">🛒 Check Price on Amazon - $129.95</a>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 30px 0 15px 0; color: #2c3e50;\">2. Adidas Everyset - Best Budget-Friendly Option</h3>\n\n<p>Don't let the affordable price fool you – the Everyset punches well above its weight class. After putting these through three months of varied training sessions, from Olympic lifts to metabolic conditioning, they've proven remarkably durable and versatile. The dual-density EVA foam provides excellent responsiveness for under $60, making these an outstanding choice for beginner and intermediate athletes. I particularly appreciate the full rubber outsole that maintains grip across different gym surfaces.</p>\n\n<p>The Everyset shines in its simplicity and functionality. While it lacks some premium features of higher-end models, it delivers where it matters most – stability under load and comfort during extended training sessions. I've worn these for 2-hour training sessions without significant discomfort, and they've shown minimal wear after extensive use. For budget-conscious athletes seeking <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-training-shoes\" style=\"color: #0066cc;\">best training shoes</a></b> without compromise, the Everyset represents exceptional value.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://amazon.com/dp/B0D2JGM27J?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #28a745 0%, #34ce57 100%); color: white; padding: 12px 25px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 25px; font-weight: 600; margin: 15px 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\">💰 Best Value on Amazon - $56.40</a>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 30px 0 15px 0; color: #2c3e50;\">3. Adidas Powerlift 5 - Weightlifting Specialist</h3>\n\n<p>For serious powerlifters and Olympic weightlifters, the Powerlift 5 represents purpose-built engineering excellence. The 15mm heel raise facilitates proper squat depth and ankle mobility, while the incredibly stiff heel counter (rated 5/5 for rigidity) provides uncompromising stability. During my powerlifting phase, these shoes helped me achieve personal records in both squat and clean &amp; jerk movements. The dual strap and lace system creates a lockdown feel that's essential for heavy lifting.</p>\n\n<p>What sets the Powerlift 5 apart is its specialization without compromise. While not ideal for dynamic movements or running, it excels in its intended purpose. The lightweight construction (15.0 oz) reduces fatigue during long training sessions, and the sustainable materials align with modern environmental consciousness. For athletes primarily focused on <i><b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-training-shoes-for-men\" style=\"color: #0066cc;\">best training shoes for men</a></b></i> in powerlifting or Olympic lifting, this shoe is indispensable.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://amazon.com/dp/B09KP4RLTF?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #6f42c1 0%, #8f5ed6 100%); color: white; padding: 12px 25px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 25px; font-weight: 600; margin: 15px 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\">⚡ Check Amazon Price - $84.99</a>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 30px 0 15px 0; color: #2c3e50;\">4. Adidas RapidMove ADV 2 - HIIT and Circuit Training Master</h3>\n\n<p>For high-intensity interval training and circuit workouts, the RapidMove ADV 2 stands in a class of its own. The Lightstrike Pro midsole provides exceptional energy return during explosive movements, while maintaining enough stability for moderate weight training up to 225 pounds. I've tested these extensively in Orange Theory classes and bootcamp-style workouts, where the responsive cushioning truly shines during repeated jump sequences and direction changes.</p>\n\n<p>The Continental rubber outsole grips phenomenally well during lateral movements and quick transitions, something I've verified across different flooring types. The Torsion System through the midfoot adds stability during single-leg exercises, a feature that becomes crucial during unilateral training. For athletes whose training emphasizes <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-ladies-training-shoes\" style=\"color: #0066cc;\">best ladies training shoes</a></b> or metabolic conditioning, this shoe delivers performance that matches its aggressive aesthetic.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"personal-experience\" style=\"margin: 40px 0;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #1a1a1a; border-bottom: 3px solid #0066cc; padding-bottom: 10px;\">My Personal Experience Testing These Shoes</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://assets.adidas.com/images/h_840,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy,c_fill,g_auto/402c6e9b02a44981a51471f5b66552dd_9366/Dropset_3_Training_Shoes_Black_IH8292_HM1.jpg\" alt=\"Black Adidas Dropset 3 training shoes showing premium design and construction details ideal for serious athletic performance\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\n<p>My journey with Adidas training shoes began three years ago when my old Nike Metcons finally gave out during a particularly brutal CrossFit session in Denver. Skeptical but curious, I picked up my first pair of Dropset 2s, and they immediately impressed me with their stability during heavy back squats. Fast-forward to today, and I've logged over 1,000 training hours across seven different Adidas models, testing them in conditions ranging from humid Miami gyms to high-altitude Colorado facilities.</p>\n\n<p>The most memorable test came during a three-week intensive training camp where I alternated between powerlifting sessions in the morning and CrossFit WODs in the evening. The Dropset 3s proved their versatility by handling 500+ pound deadlifts in the AM, then seamlessly transitioning to box jumps and rope climbs hours later. What struck me most was the durability – after six months of this abuse, they showed minimal wear patterns and maintained their structural integrity. The breathability factor became crucial during summer training in Phoenix, where the innovative ventilation system kept my feet comfortable during 2-hour sessions in 110°F heat.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most valuable insight came from comparing these shoes across different training environments. At a local powerlifting gym, veteran lifters consistently praised the heel stability of both the Dropset 3 and Powerlift 5. Meanwhile, at CrossFit gyms, athletes appreciated the versatility and durability during rope climbs and box jumps. The feedback from fellow athletes, combined with my personal testing, convinced me that Adidas had cracked the code on multi-purpose training footwear. These shoes don't just perform well in individual categories – they excel at being adaptable, which is exactly what modern fitness demands.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); color: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n<h4 style=\"margin: 0 0 10px 0; font-size: 1.2rem;\">Pro Tip from Experience:</h4>\n<p style=\"margin: 0; font-style: italic;\">\"After extensive testing, I recommend breaking in Adidas training shoes with lighter workouts for the first week.

Through extensive testing with loads exceeding 500 pounds, I've found that the Powerlift 5 and Dropset 3 represent the gold standard. The Powerlift 5's 15mm heel elevation and rigid construction make it ideal for squatting and Olympic lifts, while the Dropset 3's dual-density design provides versatility for accessory work. Both shoes feature heel counters rated 5/5 for stiffness, ensuring zero energy loss during heavy lifts.</p>\n\n<p>For athletes serious about <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-training-shoes-for-sprinters\" style=\"color: #0066cc;\">best training shoes for sprinters</a></b> who also incorporate heavy strength training, the Dropset 3 offers the perfect compromise. Its 6mm drop provides enough heel elevation for most lifters while maintaining the flexibility needed for explosive movements. After six months of heavy training, including multiple 400+ pound squat sessions, both models showed exceptional durability with minimal sole compression or upper wear.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 30px 0 15px 0; color: #2c3e50;\">For CrossFit and Functional Fitness</h3>\n\n<p>CrossFit demands the ultimate Swiss Army knife of training shoes – something that can handle everything from heavy deadlifts to rope climbs to short runs. After testing various models across dozens of different WOD styles, the Dropset 3 emerges as the clear winner. Its breathability becomes crucial during high-intensity sessions, while the durable upper materials withstand the abrasion from rope climbs and burpees. The 14.9% greater flexibility compared to average training shoes allows for natural foot movement during dynamic exercises.</p>\n\n<p>For budget-conscious CrossFitters, the Everyset provides surprising capability at half the price. While it lacks some premium features, it delivers solid performance across varied movements. I've successfully used these shoes for everything from heavy Clean &amp; Jerks to 400-meter runs, though they show their limitations in extended running portions of workouts. For comprehensive <i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-all-around-training-shoes\" style=\"color: #0066cc;\">best all-around training shoes</a></i> guidance, the Everyset represents exceptional value in the CrossFit space.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 30px 0 15px 0; color: #2c3e50;\">For HIIT and Circuit Training</h3>\n\n<p>High-intensity interval training places unique demands on footwear – you need responsive cushioning for repeated jumping movements, lateral stability for direction changes, and breathability for sustained high heart rates. The RapidMove ADV 2 excels in this category with its Lightstrike Pro midsole providing 15% better energy return than standard EVA foam. During intense Orange Theory sessions and bootcamp classes, this energy return becomes noticeable during the final rounds when fatigue sets in.</p>\n\n<p>The Continental rubber outsole grips exceptionally well on various surfaces, from rubber gym mats to concrete floors. This traction becomes crucial during lateral movements and quick transitions between exercise stations. For women seeking specialized performance, these shoes also excel as <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-training-sneakers-for-women\" style=\"color: #0066cc;\">best training sneakers for women</a></b> due to their responsive feel and secure fit that accommodates the anatomical differences in women's feet.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WIK3mNk_Dc4\" title=\"Best Adidas Gym Shoes for Lifting, HIIT, and More (Buying Guide 2025)\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\"></iframe>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"user-reviews\" style=\"margin: 40px 0;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #1a1a1a; border-bottom: 3px solid #0066cc; padding-bottom: 10px;\">What Real Users Are Saying: Review Analysis</h2>\n\n<div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr)); gap: 20px; margin: 30px 0;\">\n\n<div style=\"background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; border-left: 4px solid #28a745;\">\n<h4 style=\"margin: 0 0 10px 0; color: #28a745; font-weight: 600;\">Amazon Verified Buyer - Dropset 3</h4>\n<p style=\"margin: 0; font-style: italic; color: #6c757d;\">\"I've been lifting for 15 years and these are hands down the best training shoes I've owned.

The most common praise focuses on stability during lifting and durability over time, while criticisms typically center on specialized use cases outside their intended purpose. For athletes seeking <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-nike-training-shoes\" style=\"color: #0066cc;\">best Nike training shoes</a></b> alternatives, Adidas consistently matches or exceeds performance expectations while often providing better value.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"buying-guide\" style=\"margin: 40px 0;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #1a1a1a; border-bottom: 3px solid #0066cc; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Buying Guide: Key Features to Consider</h2>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 30px 0 15px 0; color: #2c3e50;\">Midsole Technology and Stability</h3>\n\n<p>The midsole represents the heart of any training shoe, and Adidas employs several technologies across their lineup. Dual-density construction, found in the Dropset series, provides the ideal balance between stability and responsiveness. The firmer heel section (typically 45-50 HA hardness) ensures stability during heavy lifts, while the softer forefoot (30-35 HA) allows natural foot movement during dynamic exercises. During my testing, shoes with proper dual-density design consistently outperformed single-density alternatives in both lifting stability and athletic performance.</p>\n\n<p>EVA foam remains the standard for training shoes, but Adidas's Lightstrike technology represents a significant advancement. Testing revealed 15% better energy return compared to standard EVA, which becomes noticeable during high-repetition exercises like box jumps or burpees. For athletes focused on <i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/training-shoes-for-men\" style=\"color: #0066cc;\">training shoes for men</a></i> with maximum performance, investing in Lightstrike-equipped models pays dividends during intense training sessions.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 30px 0 15px 0; color: #2c3e50;\">Upper Construction and Durability</h3>\n\n<p>Training shoe uppers endure significantly more stress than running shoes, facing everything from rope climb abrasion to heavy weight pressure. Adidas addresses this with strategic reinforcements in high-wear areas. The Dropset 3 features synthetic overlays at stress points, while maintaining breathable mesh panels elsewhere. After six months of testing, these strategic reinforcements showed their value – areas without reinforcement showed wear, while protected zones remained intact.</p>\n\n<p>Breathability becomes crucial during extended training sessions or hot weather conditions. Adidas's ventilation systems, including the unique Airflow Window in some models, provide 5/5 rated breathability without compromising structural integrity. For athletes training in humid conditions or those who prioritize <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/training-shoes-for-women\" style=\"color: #0066cc;\">training shoes for women</a></b> with superior comfort, ventilation should be a primary consideration.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 30px 0 15px 0; color: #2c3e50;\">Sizing and Fit Considerations</h3>\n\n<p>Proper fit remains critical for training shoe performance, and Adidas models vary significantly in their fit characteristics. The Dropset series runs slightly wide, making them ideal for athletes with broader feet or those who prefer room for toe splay during lifting. Conversely, the Everyset fits more narrow and may require sizing up for wider feet. I recommend trying shoes on later in the day when feet are slightly swollen, mimicking conditions during intense training sessions.</p>\n\n<p>Heel-to-toe drop significantly impacts performance and comfort. Zero-drop shoes like The Total provide maximum ground contact but may feel awkward initially. The 6mm drop in the Dropset 3 offers a sweet spot for most athletes, while the 15mm drop in the Powerlift 5 specifically benefits squatting mechanics. For comprehensive guidance on <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/best-outdoor-training-shoes\" style=\"color: #0066cc;\">best outdoor training shoes</a></b>, consider drop height as it affects both comfort and performance across different exercise types.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); color: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n<h4 style=\"margin: 0 0 15px 0; font-size: 1.3rem; text-align: center;\">Quick Buying Decision Matrix</h4>\n<div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)); gap: 15px; margin-top: 15px;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center; padding: 10px;\">\n<strong>Heavy Lifting Focus</strong><br>\n→ Powerlift 5 or Dropset 3\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; padding: 10px;\">\n<strong>CrossFit/Functional</strong><br>\n→ Dropset 3 or Everyset\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; padding: 10px;\">\n<strong>HIIT/Circuit Training</strong><br>\n→ RapidMove ADV 2\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; padding: 10px;\">\n<strong>Budget Under $70</strong><br>\n→ Everyset or Dropset 2\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<a href=\"https://amazon.com/dp/B0BGMFLH3M?tag=natureguests00-20\" style=\"display: inline-block; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #17a2b8 0%, #20c997 100%); color: white; padding: 12px 25px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 25px; font-weight: 600; margin: 15px 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\">🏆 Check Dropset 2 Deal - $74.94</a>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"conclusion\" style=\"margin: 40px 0;\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #1a1a1a; border-bottom: 3px solid #0066cc; padding-bottom: 10px;\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>After extensive testing across diverse training environments and consulting with fellow athletes, trainers, and sports scientists, Adidas has clearly established itself as the premier choice for serious training footwear in 2025.

For heavy powerlifting specifically, the Adidas Powerlift 5 provides a more specialized approach with its 15mm heel raise and rigid construction. I've successfully deadlifted over 500 pounds in the Dropset 3, while the Powerlift 5 excels for squatting movements due to its elevated heel and rock-solid platform. Both shoes feature heel counters rated 5/5 for stiffness, ensuring zero energy loss during maximum lifts.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 25px 0 10px 0; color: #2c3e50;\">Are Adidas training shoes good for CrossFit?</h3>\n<p>Yes, several Adidas models excel for CrossFit training. The Dropset 3 offers the best versatility for varied WODs, handling everything from heavy Olympic lifts to rope climbs and short runs. The Everyset provides excellent value for budget-conscious CrossFitters, delivering solid performance across functional movements. Both feature durable construction essential for the abrasion from rope climbs and floor exercises. After testing in multiple CrossFit boxes, these shoes consistently outperformed competitors in durability and versatility. The breathability becomes crucial during high-intensity workouts, and Adidas's ventilation systems handle this admirably.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 25px 0 10px 0; color: #2c3e50;\">How do Adidas training shoes fit compared to running shoes?</h3>\n<p>Adidas training shoes typically fit true to size but with a slightly wider toe box than running shoes to accommodate toe splay during lifting. The Dropset 3 runs slightly wide, making it ideal for broader feet, while the Everyset fits more narrow and may require sizing up for wider feet. Training shoes also feature lower heel-to-toe drops (0-6mm) compared to running shoes (8-12mm), creating a more stable platform. I recommend trying them on later in the day when feet are slightly swollen, and consider that the midfoot straps in many models provide additional security that running shoes lack.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 25px 0 10px 0; color: #2c3e50;\">What's the difference between Adidas Dropset 2 and Dropset 3?</h3>\n<p>The Dropset 3 features significant improvements over its predecessor, including enhanced upper ventilation with strategic mesh placement, updated dual-density midsole construction for better stability-to-flexibility balance, and improved durability in high-wear areas. The heel counter is more supportive in the Dropset 3, providing superior stability during heavy lifts while maintaining the flexibility needed for dynamic movements. Material quality has been upgraded throughout, with better synthetic overlays and more durable outsole compounds. Based on my testing of both models, the Dropset 3 represents a meaningful evolution that justifies the slightly higher price point.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 25px 0 10px 0; color: #2c3e50;\">Can I use Adidas training shoes for running?</h3>\n<p>While possible for short distances or treadmill workouts under 2-3 miles, Adidas training shoes aren't optimized for extended running. They lack the specialized cushioning and heel-to-toe transition geometry of dedicated running shoes. The firmer midsoles that provide stability for lifting become less comfortable over longer distances. For occasional running as part of CrossFit WODs or circuit training, models like the Dropset 3 handle short distances adequately. However, for regular running training, consider the Adidas Ultraboost series or other running-specific models. The Continental rubber outsoles do provide excellent traction for outdoor running, but the overall design prioritizes stability over running efficiency.</p>\n</section>\n\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"Which Adidas training shoe is best for weightlifting?\",\n      \"@id\": \"#faq-weightlifting\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"The Adidas Dropset 3 is the best overall choice for weightlifting, offering exceptional stability with its dual-density midsole and 6mm heel-to-toe drop.
