Three days in, my \"waterproof\" boots were soaked through, my feet were a mess of blisters, and I was questioning every life choice that led me to that miserable moment. That experience taught me a hard lesson: when it comes to <strong>hunting and fishing hiking boots</strong>, there's no room for compromise.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past twenty years, I've tested dozens of boot models across every conceivable terrain and weather condition. From pre-dawn duck hunts in Louisiana swamps to multi-day backpack hunts in Colorado's high country, I've pushed these boots to their limits. What I discovered is that the perfect pair of <b>hunting and fishing hiking boots</b> doesn't exist—but understanding your specific needs and the trade-offs involved can get you pretty close.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge with hunting and fishing hiking boots lies in their dual-purpose nature. Unlike specialized <i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/hunting-and-fishing-boots\" style=\"color: #4a7c59;\">hunting and fishing boots</a></i> designed for specific activities, these boots must excel in multiple environments. You might start your day hiking five miles to a remote fishing spot, then spend hours wading through streams, and end up tracking game through thick brush.</p>\n\n<p>This versatility requirement makes choosing the right boots more complex than selecting single-purpose footwear. Through extensive field testing and countless conversations with fellow hunters and anglers, I've identified the key factors that separate exceptional hunting and fishing hiking boots from the mediocre ones. In this guide, I'll share those insights and help you avoid the costly mistakes I made early in my outdoor career.</p>\n\n<p>My approach to evaluating boots has evolved significantly over the years. Initially, I focused primarily on waterproof ratings and price points. Now I understand that factors like breathability, durability under specific conditions, and long-term comfort during extended wear are equally important. I've also learned that what works for one person's foot shape and hunting style may be completely wrong for another's.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"essential-features\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2d5a27; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; border-bottom: 2px solid #a8d5ba; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Essential Features That Make Great Hunting and Fishing Hiking Boots</h2>\n\n<p>After testing over fifty different models of <strong>hunting and fishing hiking boots</strong>, I've identified seven critical features that separate the exceptional from the mediocre. These features determine whether your boots will enhance your outdoor experience or become a source of misery miles from the nearest road.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">Waterproof Technology That Actually Works</h3>\n\n<p>The most important feature in hunting and fishing hiking boots is genuine waterproof performance. I've learned the hard way that \"water-resistant\" and \"waterproof\" are not the same thing. True waterproof boots use membrane technology like Gore-Tex, eVent, or proprietary systems that create a barrier between your feet and external moisture.</p>\n\n<p>However, waterproofing comes with trade-offs. The same membrane that keeps water out also restricts breathability, which can lead to moisture buildup from foot sweat. This is why many experienced hunters and anglers own multiple pairs of boots—waterproof options for wet conditions and breathable alternatives for dry, warm weather.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">Traction Systems for Variable Terrain</h3>\n\n<p>Quality hunting and fishing hiking boots must provide reliable traction across diverse surfaces. The best boots feature aggressive lug patterns with deep grooves that shed mud and debris while maintaining grip on wet rocks, loose soil, and steep terrain. Vibram soles have proven consistently superior in my testing, particularly for mixed hunting and fishing applications.</p>\n\n<p>I've found that boots with too aggressive a tread pattern can actually be detrimental for hunting, as they tend to collect debris and make noise. The ideal traction system balances grip with stealth, allowing you to move quietly through various terrains without sacrificing safety.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">Durability for Long-Term Performance</h3>\n\n<img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81swl66gCvL._UY900_.jpg\" alt=\"Durable camo hunting and fishing hiking boots for outdoor adventures\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 500px; height: auto; margin: 1rem auto; border-radius: 8px; display: block;\">\n\n<p>The construction quality of <b>hunting and fishing hiking boots</b> directly impacts their lifespan and performance reliability. Premium boots typically feature full-grain leather or high-grade synthetic uppers, reinforced stitching, and replaceable components. I've noticed that boots with welted construction generally last longer than those with cemented soles, though they're often heavier.</p>\n\n<p>Pay special attention to high-wear areas like the toe cap, heel counter, and areas where the upper meets the sole. Quality boots reinforce these zones with additional materials or specialized construction techniques. The investment in durable construction pays dividends when you're fifty miles from civilization.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">Insulation Considerations</h3>\n\n<p>Insulation in hunting and fishing hiking boots is a double-edged sword. While insulated boots provide warmth in cold conditions, they can cause overheating and excessive sweating during active periods. I typically recommend non-insulated boots for early season and high-activity hunts, reserving insulated options for late season or stationary activities like stand hunting.</p>\n\n<p>When insulation is necessary, synthetic materials like Thinsulate offer better moisture management than traditional materials. However, the best approach for most hunters and anglers is layering—using quality merino wool socks in non-insulated boots provides adjustable warmth without the bulk.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"top-reviews\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2d5a27; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; border-bottom: 2px solid #a8d5ba; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Top 5 Hunting and Fishing Hiking Boots: Comprehensive Reviews</h2>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3oKQv9FdwHE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"margin: 1rem 0; border-radius: 8px;\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Based on extensive field testing across multiple seasons and terrains, these five models represent the best <strong>hunting and fishing hiking boots</strong> currently available.

Temperature, precipitation, terrain conditions, and activity levels all change dramatically throughout the year, requiring different boot characteristics for optimal performance.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">Early Season: August Through October</h3>\n\n<p>Early season hunting and fishing typically involves warmer temperatures, dry conditions, and high activity levels. During this period, breathability often trumps insulation, and lightweight construction becomes a significant advantage during long hikes to remote locations.</p>\n\n<p>For early season use, I recommend non-insulated <b>hunting and fishing hiking boots</b> with moderate waterproofing. Look for boots with mesh panels or breathable synthetic uppers that allow moisture vapor to escape while providing adequate protection from morning dew and light precipitation. The focus should be on comfort during extended wear and minimal weight for long-distance hiking.</p>\n\n<p>Popular activities during early season include bow hunting for deer and elk, high-country fishing, and upland bird hunting. These activities often require covering significant distances on foot, making lightweight, comfortable boots essential. Consider pairing quality boots with moisture-wicking merino wool socks and lightweight gaiters for added protection.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">Mid Season: November</h3>\n\n<p>Mid-season presents the greatest challenge for <i>hunting and fishing hiking boots</i> selection, as conditions can vary dramatically from warm, dry days to cold, wet weather. This transitional period requires boots that can handle diverse conditions without forcing you to carry multiple pairs.</p>\n\n<p>The ideal mid-season boot offers moderate insulation (200-400 grams), reliable waterproofing, and versatile traction. Look for boots that balance thermal protection with breathability, allowing you to remain comfortable during both active stalking and stationary stand hunting.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">Late Season: December and Beyond</h3>\n\n<p>Late season hunting often involves extreme cold, snow, and extended periods of stationary activity. During this time, warmth becomes the primary concern, sometimes outweighing other considerations like weight and breathability.</p>\n\n<p>For late season use, heavily insulated boots (600-1400 grams) with superior waterproofing become essential. These conditions favor boots designed for thermal protection over those optimized for hiking performance. Many hunters switch to pac boots or heavily insulated hiking boots during this period, accepting the weight penalty for enhanced cold weather performance.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the specific activities planned during late season. Stand hunting in extreme cold requires different boots than active late-season elk hunting. Matching boot characteristics to planned activities ensures optimal comfort and safety in challenging conditions.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"testing-experience\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2d5a27; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; border-bottom: 2px solid #a8d5ba; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">My Real-World Testing Experience: What Works and What Doesn't</h2>\n\n<p>Over the past twenty years, I've systematically tested <strong>hunting and fishing hiking boots</strong> across every conceivable condition and terrain. This real-world testing has revealed significant gaps between manufacturer claims and actual performance, leading to some hard-learned lessons about boot selection and care.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">The Great Waterproof Boot Myth</h3>\n\n<p>One of the most important lessons from my testing involves waterproof performance. Despite manufacturer claims, I've never found a truly waterproof boot that maintains its barrier properties indefinitely. Even premium boots from brands like Kenetrek and Crispi eventually develop leaks, typically around high-flex areas or where the upper meets the sole.</p>\n\n<p>During a particularly memorable elk hunt in Washington's Olympic Mountains, I tested six different pairs of supposedly waterproof <b>hunting and fishing hiking boots</b> simultaneously. After three days of constant rain and stream crossings, four of the six pairs had developed leaks. The two that remained dry were the heaviest, most expensive options—and they caused significant foot sweating issues.</p>\n\n<p>This experience taught me that waterproof performance has a limited lifespan, and the membrane technology that keeps water out also traps moisture inside. The key is understanding these limitations and planning accordingly, rather than expecting perfect performance indefinitely.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">Durability Testing Results</h3>\n\n<p>My systematic durability testing involves wearing boots for a minimum of 100 miles across varied terrain before making recommendations. This testing has revealed significant differences in construction quality and longevity among different brands and price points.</p>\n\n<p>Premium boots like those from Kenetrek consistently outperform mid-range options in durability testing, but the difference isn't always proportional to the price premium. Some moderately priced boots from companies like Merrell and Salomon offer surprising longevity when properly maintained, while certain expensive European brands show premature wear in American conditions.</p>\n\n<p>The most common failure points in my testing are sole separation, waterproof membrane degradation, and eyelet pullout. Boots with welted construction typically outlast those with cemented soles, though they're often heavier and more expensive initially.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">User Reviews from the Field</h3>\n\n<p>Beyond my personal testing, I've collected feedback from dozens of hunting and fishing partners who've used various boots in real-world conditions. Here are three representative user experiences that illustrate common patterns:</p>\n\n<div style=\"background: #e8f5e8; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #4a7c59; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n<p><strong>Jake M., Colorado Elk Hunter:</strong> \"I've been using Kenetrek Mountain Extremes for four seasons now. They're heavy, but I've never had wet feet, even during week-long backcountry trips. The break-in period was brutal—took about 40 miles before they felt comfortable. Worth every penny for serious hunting.\"</p>\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"background: #e8f5e8; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #4a7c59; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n<p><strong>Sarah T., Montana Fly Fisher:</strong> \"Switched to Simms wading boots after my hiking boots kept slipping on wet rocks. Night and day difference for stream fishing, but they're not great for long hikes to remote spots. I keep both types in my truck now depending on the day's plan.\"</p>\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"background: #e8f5e8; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #4a7c59; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n<p><strong>Mike D., Texas Whitetail Hunter:</strong> \"Crispi boots worked great for two seasons, then started leaking at the toe. Customer service was excellent—they replaced them under warranty. The replacement pair has held up better, maybe I got a defective first pair. Still recommend them overall.\"</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>These experiences highlight common themes in <i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/hunting-and-fishing-supplies\" style=\"color: #4a7c59;\">hunting and fishing supplies</a></i>: individual fit and use patterns significantly impact performance, even premium products can fail, and having backup options is wise for serious outdoor enthusiasts.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"common-mistakes\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2d5a27; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; border-bottom: 2px solid #a8d5ba; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Common Mistakes When Choosing Hunting and Fishing Hiking Boots</h2>\n\n<p>After twenty years of testing boots and helping fellow outdoorsmen select appropriate footwear, I've identified several common mistakes that lead to poor performance and uncomfortable experiences. Avoiding these pitfalls can save you money and prevent miserable days in the field.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">Mistake #1: Prioritizing Price Over Fit</h3>\n\n<p>The most common mistake I see is choosing <strong>hunting and fishing hiking boots</strong> based primarily on price rather than fit and intended use. A $150 boot that fits perfectly and meets your specific needs will outperform a $400 boot that doesn't match your foot shape or activity requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Proper fit involves more than just length and width. Consider your foot shape, arch height, and toe box preferences. Many hunters and anglers benefit from trying boots on at the end of the day when feet are naturally swollen, simulating conditions after hours of wear in the field.</p>\n\n<p>Don't assume that expensive boots will automatically provide superior performance for your specific needs. Sometimes a moderately priced boot from a mainstream manufacturer offers better value and performance than premium specialty boots, especially for casual users.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">Mistake #2: Ignoring Break-In Requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Many hunters and anglers purchase new boots just before important trips, expecting them to perform flawlessly immediately. This approach almost always leads to blisters, hot spots, and compromised performance when it matters most.</p>\n\n<p>Quality <b>hunting and fishing hiking boots</b> require a break-in period ranging from 20-50 miles of varied use. Start this process at least a month before any important trips, gradually increasing wear time and terrain difficulty. Use the same socks you'll wear in the field during break-in to identify potential problems.</p>\n\n<p>Some boots, particularly those with stiff construction like Kenetrek and premium European brands, require extensive break-in periods. Factor this time commitment into your boot selection process, especially if you have important trips planned.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">Mistake #3: Misunderstanding Waterproof vs. Water-Resistant</h3>\n\n<p>The terminology used to describe water protection in boots often confuses buyers, leading to inappropriate selections for intended conditions. \"Water-resistant\" boots provide protection from light moisture but will fail in prolonged wet conditions. \"Waterproof\" boots incorporate membrane technology but sacrifice breathability.</p>\n\n<p>Consider your typical hunting and fishing conditions when evaluating water protection needs. If you primarily hunt in dry conditions with occasional light moisture, breathable water-resistant boots may provide better overall comfort than fully waterproof options.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that even waterproof boots will eventually leak with heavy use. Plan for this reality by learning proper boot maintenance techniques and having backup options for critical situations.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">Mistake #4: Overlooking Seasonal Requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Many outdoor enthusiasts try to find one pair of <i>hunting and fishing hiking boots</i> that work year-round, often resulting in compromised performance during certain seasons. While versatile boots exist, they typically represent compromises rather than optimal solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Consider investing in two pairs of boots—one optimized for warm weather and active use, another designed for cold weather and stationary activities. This approach provides better performance throughout the hunting and fishing seasons while potentially extending the life of both pairs.</p>\n\n<p>When budget constraints limit you to one pair, choose boots optimized for your most challenging or important activities. It's better to have boots that excel in critical situations than ones that provide mediocre performance across all conditions.</p>\n\n<p>For additional guidance on selecting appropriate <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/hunting-and-fishing-apparel\" style=\"color: #4a7c59;\">hunting and fishing apparel</a></b> to complement your boot choice, consider factors like gaiters, sock selection, and layering systems that work together for optimal performance.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"conclusion\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2d5a27; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; border-bottom: 2px solid #a8d5ba; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Conclusion: Finding Your Perfect Hunting and Fishing Hiking Boots</h2>\n\n<p>After two decades of testing, reviewing, and using countless pairs of <strong>hunting and fishing hiking boots</strong> across diverse conditions and terrains, I've learned that the perfect boot doesn't exist—but the right boot for your specific needs absolutely does. The key lies in understanding your priorities, activity patterns, and the trade-offs inherent in any footwear design.</p>\n\n<p>The most important lesson from my testing experience is that no single pair of boots excels in every situation. Early season hunting demands different characteristics than late season stand hunting. Stream fishing requires different features than backcountry elk hunting. The most successful hunters and anglers I know own multiple pairs of boots, each optimized for specific conditions and activities.</p>\n\n<p>If budget constraints limit you to one pair, focus on boots that perform well in your most challenging or frequent activities. A boot that keeps your feet dry and comfortable during your most demanding adventures will serve you better than one that provides mediocre performance across all conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that even the highest-quality hunting and fishing hiking boots require proper care and maintenance. Regular cleaning, appropriate waterproofing treatments, and proper storage significantly extend boot life and maintain performance. Consider these maintenance requirements when selecting boots, as some require more care than others.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, don't underestimate the importance of proper fit and break-in procedures. The most expensive, feature-rich boots in the world will make you miserable if they don't fit properly or aren't properly broken in. Take the time to find boots that match your foot shape and allow adequate break-in time before important trips.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you're shopping for your first pair of serious hunting boots or upgrading from worn-out favorites, use this guide as a starting point for your research. Test boots in person when possible, read reviews from users with similar needs, and don't hesitate to invest in quality footwear—your feet will thank you miles down the trail.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about selecting complementary gear, check out our guides on <i><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/hunting-and-fishing-clothing\" style=\"color: #4a7c59;\">hunting and fishing clothing</a></i> and <b><a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/wet-weather-gear-hunting-and-fishing\" style=\"color: #4a7c59;\">wet weather gear for hunting and fishing</a></b> to complete your outdoor kit.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"faq-section\">\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 2rem; color: #2d5a27; margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; border-bottom: 2px solid #a8d5ba; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">What makes hunting and fishing hiking boots different from regular hiking boots?</h3>\n\n<p>Hunting and fishing hiking boots are specifically designed for outdoor activities that require extended periods in wet, rugged terrain. They typically feature enhanced waterproofing, superior traction for wet surfaces, scent control materials, and more durable construction to withstand harsh conditions. Many also include specialized features like snake protection, insulation options, and quieter materials for stealth movement during hunting. Regular hiking boots prioritize comfort and breathability for dry trail conditions, while hunting and fishing boots emphasize weather protection and durability.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">How long should quality hunting and fishing hiking boots last?</h3>\n\n<p>Quality hunting and fishing hiking boots should last 2-5 years with regular use, depending on the frequency of use and terrain conditions. Premium brands like Kenetrek and Crispi often last 3-5 years, while mid-range options typically last 2-3 years. The waterproof membrane is usually the first component to fail, followed by sole wear. Proper maintenance, including regular cleaning and waterproofing treatments, can significantly extend boot life. Heavy users who hunt or fish frequently may need to replace boots more often than casual users.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">Should I choose insulated or non-insulated hunting and fishing hiking boots?</h3>\n\n<p>Choose non-insulated boots for early season hunting (August-October) and active hiking to prevent overheating and excessive foot sweat. Insulated boots work best for late season hunting (November-December) and when sitting in stands or blinds for extended periods. Many experienced hunters own both types and switch based on activity level and temperature. For fishing, non-insulated boots are typically preferred unless you're in extremely cold conditions. The key is matching insulation levels to your activity level and expected temperatures.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">What's the best way to break in new hunting and fishing hiking boots?</h3>\n\n<p>Start by wearing new boots for short periods indoors with hunting socks to identify pressure points. Gradually increase wear time over 2-3 weeks, beginning with easy terrain before tackling challenging hikes. Use quality merino wool socks and consider moleskin for hot spots. Never break in boots during an important hunting trip. Some hunters recommend wearing boots while doing yard work or short neighborhood walks to accelerate the process safely. Allow at least 20-50 miles of varied use before depending on boots for serious outdoor activities.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; color: #4a7c59; margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;\">How do I maintain waterproofing in my hunting and fishing hiking boots?</h3>\n\n<p>Clean boots thoroughly after each use, removing all mud and debris. Allow them to air dry completely before storing. Apply waterproofing treatments like Nikwax, Sno-Seal, or manufacturer-specific products every 3-4 months or after 20-30 hours of use. For leather boots, use appropriate leather conditioners to maintain flexibility. Store boots in a cool, dry place and avoid extreme heat which can damage waterproof membranes. Regular maintenance significantly extends waterproof performance, though all boots will eventually require replacement as membranes wear out over time.</p>\n</section>\n\n<div style=\"background: #2d5a27; color: white; padding: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; border-radius: 8px; text-align: center;\">\n    <h3 style=\"margin: 0 0 1rem 0; color: white;\">Ready to Find Your Perfect Boots?</h3>\n    <p style=\"margin: 0 0 1.5rem 0;\">Explore our complete selection of hunting and fishing gear to complement your new boots.</p>\n    <div style=\"display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center; gap: 1rem;\">\n        <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/hunting-and-fishing-stores\" style=\"background: #4a7c59; color: white; padding: 10px 20px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block;\">Find Local Stores</a>\n        <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/hunting-and-fishing-pants\" style=\"background: #4a7c59; color: white; padding: 10px 20px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block;\">Browse Pants</a>\n        <a href=\"https://explorenationalparks.store/hunting-and-fishing-rain-jacket\" style=\"background: #4a7c59; color: white; padding: 10px 20px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block;\">Rain Jackets</a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<footer style=\"margin-top: 2rem; padding-top: 2rem; border-top: 2px solid #a8d5ba; text-align: center; color: #666;\">\n    <p>© 2024 Explore National Parks Store.
